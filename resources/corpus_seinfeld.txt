BETSY: I'll be in my office if you need me.
BETSY: No. GEORGE: This prison stinks.
BETSY: There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility.
BETSY: Those are our tennis courts.
BETTE: Get me one of those Black and White cookies. Kramer: yeah, all right, yeah
BETTE: Get some talent then you can mouth off.
BETTE: Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not going to be very pleasant to be around.
BETTE: Hi.
BETTE: How about Pineapple?
BETTE: Macaroni Midler?
BETTE: Move it in. Move in everybody. Get your shrimp here. Shrimp on special today!

BIKER: About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! Lean!

BILLY: What do you mean?
BILLY: Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
BILLY: Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns.
BILLY: Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy.
BILLY: You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?

CASTING DIRECTOR: This is Melissa Shannon.
CASTING DIRECTOR: This is Michael Barth. Another George.
CASTING DIRECTOR: What do I do with latex?
CASTING DIRECTOR: What is that?
CASTING DIRECTOR: What is this about?
CASTING DIRECTOR: You two know each other?
CASTRO: And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one.
CASTRO: Ordinarily I would not grant such a request but I've heard you are, uh, how you say, Communista simpatico, eh?
CASTRO: Si, si. Come here. I understand you are very interested in one of our players, eh?
CASTRO: They will play for your Yankees.

CELIA: Good news - I'm up for parole.
CELIA: I said no. Now come here.
CELIA: I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone.
CELIA: If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!
CELIA: Jerry! Those hands! They never stop!
CELIA: Jerry, what are you doing?
CELIA: My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long and painful bout ...
CELIA: Nice to meet you.
CELIA: No Jerry. They're priceless. They've never been played with.
CELIA: No thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?
CELIA: No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.
CELIA: No, it's standard issue.
CELIA: Oh yeah the toys.
CELIA: So, are you the head of the foundation?
CELIA: This was fun.
CELIA: Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out. GEORGE: And you just decided to pop in...!
CELIA: What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?
CELIA: What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?
CELIA: What video did you get?
CELIA: Who's he?
CELIA: You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.

CHILES: Good morning.
CHILES: Here.
CHILES: I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them. - COMMERCIAL BREAK -
CHILES: Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?
CHILES: Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that.
CHILES: Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed.
CHILES: Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990.
CHILES: Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular.
CHILES: Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady.
CHILES: Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.
CHILES: That's right.
CHILES: Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let's move on.
CHILES: Vanda who?
CHILES: What's a Bubble Boy?
CHILES: Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?
CHILES: Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.
CHILES: You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase.
CHILES: You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away.
CHILES: Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential.
CHIROPRACTOR: I'm a chiropractor.
CHIROPRACTOR: I'm afraid not.
CHIROPRACTOR: You could aggravated. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.
CHOATE: Help - someone help.
CHOATE: I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no.

CHOATE: Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man.
CHRISTIE: Ahem! Are you looking for something?

CHRISTIE: Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.
CHRISTIE: Excuse me. Elaine? Elaine, handicapped by her neck, cannot see who's speaking.
CHRISTIE: Get out. Jerry walks though the door. He's still talking as Christie closes it
CHRISTIE: Here we are.
CHRISTIE: I know exactly what you mean.
CHRISTIE: I think your friend needs some help over there.
CHRISTIE: If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to bed.
CHRISTIE: Jerry. I don't think so. Jerry picks up his coat and moves toward the door.
CHRISTIE: No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.
CHRISTIE: Oh my god!
CHRISTIE: Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, right?
CHRISTIE: Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you. Christie walks away.
CHRISTIE: Well, I guess I'll go change.
CHRISTIE: Yes, thank you. The Maitre d' helps Christie to slip out of her coat, revealing that
CHRISTIE: Yes. How y'doing?
CINDY: All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?
CINDY: For my maid services. You booked me for today.
CINDY: Hi, Elaine.

CINDY: I don't want any money from you.
CINDY: I made the bed.
CINDY: No. My money.
CINDY: No. That was the maid.
CINDY: So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?
CINDY: So?
CINDY: Thanks Jerry, gotta run.
CINDY: Thanks, Jerry. Bye. She leaves.
CINDY: The girlfriend.
CINDY: What do you want?
CINDY: What was that?
CINDY: Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right. Cindy gets up and goes into Jerry's bedroom.
CINDY: Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again. Cindy walks out of Jerry's apartment.
CINDY: You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid.
CINDY: Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.
CLAIRE: Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.

DEAN JONES: You fly is open.
DEANSFREI: My name is Arnold Deensfrei. What is your name?

DEENA: George Costanza, is that you?
DEENA: George, I'm only trying to help... George is staring past Deena at something a short distance away.
DEENA: I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.
DEENA: I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.
DEENA: I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.
DEENA: I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?
DEENA: Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.
DEENA: Oh my God!
DEENA: Poor Lloyd.
DEENA: So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
DEENA: So, you want my father to pay for this?
DEENA: So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?
DEENA: Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop.
DEENA: That man was wearing glasses.
DEENA: That was your best friend?
DEENA: The man with the flowers?
DEENA: To park her horse?
DEENA: Uhn, it was too much for him. Pop is thumping away at part of the engine with a spanner.
DEENA: Well, I guess it's possible.
DEENA: What cashier?
DEENA: What?
DEENA: Who?
DEENA: Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
DEENA: You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again. George clearly thinks he's clicked.

DEPUTY: California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.
DEPUTY: Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison.

DOCTOR: Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
DOCTOR: All right Miss Benes . This doesn't look to serious . You'll be fine .
DOCTOR: All rightly . Let me just review your history before we begin .
DOCTOR: And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
DOCTOR: Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.
DOCTOR: Are you asking because you saw 20/20 last night?
DOCTOR: Elaine . You shouldn't be reading that . So tell me about this rash of yours .
DOCTOR: Elaine, IÂ’m used to it. IÂ’m a doctor. Elaine: Well
DOCTOR: Excuse me , Are you the husband?
DOCTOR: From your last doctor . It's a standard procedure .
DOCTOR: Fungicide? Fungus? At the church.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
DOCTOR: He, um. he's not going to be the same, you know?
DOCTOR: Hi Roy.
DOCTOR: Huh?
DOCTOR: I have no medical evidence to back me up, but something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something
DOCTOR: I just wanted to stop by to see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
DOCTOR: I was going to kiss you good night.
DOCTOR: I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
DOCTOR: I'll need a urine sample.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that.
DOCTOR: It happens.
DOCTOR: ItÂ’s my favorite toe.
DOCTOR: Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
DOCTOR: No youÂ’re not. phone rings
DOCTOR: No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
DOCTOR: Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
DOCTOR: Oh uh, whereÂ’s the bathroom?
DOCTOR: Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
DOCTOR: Oh, sorry.
DOCTOR: Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
DOCTOR: Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay . Let's take a look . Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine .
DOCTOR: One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Saying what? In JerryÂ’s girlfriendÂ’s apartment.
DOCTOR: She expired.
DOCTOR: She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
DOCTOR: Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's
DOCTOR: That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
DOCTOR: That's probably what did it.
DOCTOR: There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
DOCTOR: Think about it. Excuse me.
DOCTOR: Those can be very refreshing.
DOCTOR: Uh, hello. Uh, Mr. Costanza?
DOCTOR: We could put him to sleep.
DOCTOR: We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
DOCTOR: We have to...
DOCTOR: Well , I'm sorry.....She's gone.
DOCTOR: Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown .
DOCTOR: Well I don't know what it is.
DOCTOR: Well itÂ’s my fault. I got a little defensive.
DOCTOR: Well that report was about one very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that kind type of retractor in
DOCTOR: Well that was a long time ago . How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash ......
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't go that far.
DOCTOR: Well, it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
DOCTOR: Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
DOCTOR: Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
DOCTOR: What?
DOCTOR: Which one is the son?
DOCTOR: Y'know I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery, but I think there were other factors at play here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yes
DOCTOR: Yes , of course.
DOCTOR: Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
DOCTOR: You have 30 minutes.
DOCTOR: You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
DOCTOR: Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated.

DRIVER: Hey what about a hearing aid?
DRIVER: Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!
DRIVER: Huh?
DRIVER: I didn't take your Chuckle, man!

DRIVER: I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!
DRIVER: I told him I was gonna mess him up.
DRIVER: I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something.

DRIVER: Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior. At the tennis court. Jerry is standing behind the lineswoman.
DRIVER: Yeah, I don't read much myself, well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, but not me. You know what I do?

ELAINE: All she'll think is that you like her.
ELAINE: All time.
ELAINE: Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
ELAINE: Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
ELAINE: Alright thatÂ’s it! WeÂ’re back together!
ELAINE: Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!!

ELAINE: Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
ELAINE: Alright, IÂ’m out of here.
ELAINE: Alright, let's do it.
ELAINE: Alright, let's go.
ELAINE: Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
ELAINE: Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
ELAINE: Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it.
ELAINE: Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
ELAINE: Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.

ELAINE: Alright, what the Hell.
ELAINE: Alright.
ELAINE: Alright.
ELAINE: Alright.
ELAINE: Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
ELAINE: Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
ELAINE: Alrighty, bye.
ELAINE: An accident? What happened?
ELAINE: An addict? Well, it just keeps getting better!
ELAINE: An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
ELAINE: An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
ELAINE: An IQ test.
ELAINE: And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
ELAINE: And he gets the rest of my chicken...
ELAINE: And he happens to be pretty good lookin'
ELAINE: And he says, he says, Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, alright? And I said, Fine. Fine I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I wanted you to know that I'm aware of it.
ELAINE: And he's growing it in just for me. It's mine. It's all mine.
ELAINE: And he's has a bit of a rash .
ELAINE: And he's saying  I wish I was taller ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
ELAINE: And I could just be there. For you.
ELAINE: And I didnÂ’t like that roast beef, so how Â‘bout some lunch?
ELAINE: And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs.
ELAINE: And I'll be right upstairs?
ELAINE: And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
ELAINE: And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.
ELAINE: And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not Top of the Muffin TO YOU!!! Mr. Lippman: No. No. It is.
ELAINE: And scuba diving.
ELAINE: And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
ELAINE: And the bathroom in your apartment?
ELAINE: And the bushwomen. Man: Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I
ELAINE: And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
ELAINE: And then he starts writing on my chart .
ELAINE: And then you flush.
ELAINE: And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
ELAINE: And vodka.
ELAINE: And what time's the funeral?
ELAINE: And you get along well with women.
ELAINE: And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
ELAINE: And you stopped by just to give it to me?
ELAINE: And you're on the fringe of the humor business. George comes in
ELAINE: And... he's hilarious.
ELAINE: Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
ELAINE: Anna...
ELAINE: Answering machine.
ELAINE: Any other time.
ELAINE: Anybody here? Peterboy? No one answers. She runs over to Peterman's fridge, opens it, and takes out a box. She opens the box to find a cake.
ELAINE: anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
ELAINE: Anything else? What do you mean anything else?
ELAINE: Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told
ELAINE: Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
ELAINE: Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
ELAINE: Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby.
ELAINE: Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland.
ELAINE: Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
ELAINE: Anyway, so how was the dinner?
ELAINE: Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke..
ELAINE: Are we still going to the movies tonight?
ELAINE: Are you
ELAINE: Are you coming with me?
ELAINE: Are you doing new material?
ELAINE: Are you in a bad mood?
ELAINE: Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
ELAINE: Are you OK? What? What?
ELAINE: Are you okay?
ELAINE: Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under it? New scene - Jerry in bed at the crack of dawn. We hear a rooster crowing. Jerry gets up and knocks on Kramer's door, bleary-eyed. Kramer answers the door with a rooster under his arm.
ELAINE: Are you serious?
ELAINE: Are you sure you want to do that?
ELAINE: Are you sure you want us here for this?
ELAINE: Are you sure?
ELAINE: Argh, look at the fire!
ELAINE: Argh.. Fleas How did you get fleas?
ELAINE: Arrive? Craig.: Yes! From Milan.
ELAINE: As long as you don't put...
ELAINE: Ask about your arm.
ELAINE: Ask Jerry.
ELAINE: Ask your mother, you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
ELAINE: Astro...naut!
ELAINE: At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
ELAINE: At least it wasn't atomic.
ELAINE: At the movies.
ELAINE: At work?
ELAINE: At Yankee Stadium?
ELAINE: augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
ELAINE: Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
ELAINE: Awful. This trip was a huge mistake. Huge!
ELAINE: Babs?
ELAINE: Babu Bhatt did it.
ELAINE: Babu! If you don't mind?
ELAINE: Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
ELAINE: Bark.
ELAINE: Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch. Elaine gargles some water and they both break out in laughter.
ELAINE: Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
ELAINE: Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
ELAINE: Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
ELAINE: Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
ELAINE: Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
ELAINE: Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
ELAINE: Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
ELAINE: Because I was gooood.
ELAINE: Because I'm a woman. Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
ELAINE: Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
ELAINE: Because it's really nobody's business.
ELAINE: Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
ELAINE: Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
ELAINE: Because they're turning your teeth green?
ELAINE: Because we're adults?
ELAINE: Because you have an attitude.
ELAINE: Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and he ignores me.
ELAINE: Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?
ELAINE: Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But - as long as you're okay with it, it's fine with me.
ELAINE: Because, it is what she does.
ELAINE: Because, it's discriminatory
ELAINE: Because... Yeah?
ELAINE: Benes . My last name is Benes you jackass . Yeah . Newman walking down the street
ELAINE: Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?
ELAINE: Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
ELAINE: Binacca?
ELAINE: Black Forrest?
ELAINE: Blonde hair remember? Glasses? Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
ELAINE: Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? All right, here we go. Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
ELAINE: Boing!
ELAINE: Book it.
ELAINE: Both of the them.
ELAINE: Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um,
ELAINE: Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
ELAINE: Boy, he takes such a long time.
ELAINE: Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
ELAINE: Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
ELAINE: Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse.
ELAINE: Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
ELAINE: Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
ELAINE: Boys are sick.
ELAINE: Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
ELAINE: Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
ELAINE: Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
ELAINE: But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
ELAINE: But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
ELAINE: But he's okay ?
ELAINE: But he's so small.
ELAINE: But I didn't do Testikov did it, he should have to pay for it!
ELAINE: But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
ELAINE: But I really did like it
ELAINE: But I really enjoy dancing.
ELAINE: But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
ELAINE: But I wanted to see the bushmen.
ELAINE: But it was in pen . You fake erase .
ELAINE: But it's a line from that song!
ELAINE: But she broke up with you .
ELAINE: But that's why I got you the tighter ones!
ELAINE: But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me,
ELAINE: But we need you.
ELAINE: But we were here ahead of you.
ELAINE: But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
ELAINE: But what??
ELAINE: But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
ELAINE: But you said it was in the store!.
ELAINE: But you were!!
ELAINE: But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
ELAINE: But, Jake, I didn't...
ELAINE: But, that didn't happen to you.

ELAINE: I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
ELAINE: I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York
ELAINE: I can't take your bedroom.
ELAINE: I can't tell you.
ELAINE: I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset
ELAINE: I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
ELAINE: I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
ELAINE: I can't. I'm the best man.
ELAINE: I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
ELAINE: I cannot believe this!
ELAINE: I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
ELAINE: I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
ELAINE: I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
ELAINE: I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
ELAINE: I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
ELAINE: I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
ELAINE: I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
ELAINE: I dance fine.
ELAINE: I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
ELAINE: I did not jaywalk.
ELAINE: I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think you're funny at all.
ELAINE: I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
ELAINE: I did?
ELAINE: I didn't get it.
ELAINE: I didn't get that joke either.
ELAINE: I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
ELAINE: I didn't hear anything.
ELAINE: I didn't know who he was!
ELAINE: I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
ELAINE: I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
ELAINE: I didn't say anything.
ELAINE: I didn't take your napkins.
ELAINE: I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
ELAINE: I didn't want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
ELAINE: I do have one teeny little problem, though.
ELAINE: I do to.
ELAINE: I do.
ELAINE: I don't believe this .
ELAINE: I don't blame ya'
ELAINE: I don't buy it. Kramer walks in with more change
ELAINE: I don't care, I'm not hungry.
ELAINE: I don't care: Jimmy walks in
ELAINE: I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
ELAINE: I don't fool around, baby!
ELAINE: I don't have a fax machine.
ELAINE: I don't have five thousand dollars.
ELAINE: I don't know - it just is.
ELAINE: I don't know about that.
ELAINE: I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
ELAINE: I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
ELAINE: I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start
ELAINE: I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
ELAINE: I don't know what your parents did to you.
ELAINE: I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said I've never seen you looser.
ELAINE: I don't know!
ELAINE: I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
ELAINE: I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen. Mr. Lippman: That's a good idea.
ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
ELAINE: I don't know, I guess.
ELAINE: I don't know, who to rune for, George's place has carpeting.
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
ELAINE: I don't know. Chuck it?
ELAINE: I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
ELAINE: I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
ELAINE: I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
ELAINE: I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
ELAINE: I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
ELAINE: I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
ELAINE: I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
ELAINE: I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
ELAINE: I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. Jerry? Je... Hello?
ELAINE: I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
ELAINE: I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
ELAINE: I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
ELAINE: I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just take one more look at it.
ELAINE: I don't know...a year?
ELAINE: I don't like this , it is to easy .
ELAINE: I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it. She tosses the toupee out the window.
ELAINE: I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
ELAINE: I don't mind skunk.
ELAINE: I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.
ELAINE: I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
ELAINE: I don't remember , but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
ELAINE: I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
ELAINE: I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
ELAINE: I don't think so. Kramer enters.
ELAINE: I don't think so...
ELAINE: I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
ELAINE: I don't understand.
ELAINE: I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
ELAINE: I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
ELAINE: I don't wanna!
ELAINE: I don't want it.
ELAINE: I don't want soup. I can make my own soup.  5 cups chopped Porcine
ELAINE: I don't want to keep him waiting...
ELAINE: I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it!
ELAINE: I don,t think so.
ELAINE: I donÂ’t know.
ELAINE: I donÂ’t know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
ELAINE: I donÂ’t know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arenÂ’t real doctors.
ELAINE: I donÂ’t think so David, weÂ’re through. Puddy: Oh
ELAINE: I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
ELAINE: I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn't find it. I was... I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
ELAINE: I dropped a grape.
ELAINE: I dunno, at least three weeks.
ELAINE: I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
ELAINE: I faked it.
ELAINE: I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
ELAINE: I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
ELAINE: I found it!
ELAINE: I gave him an ultimatum.
ELAINE: I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine captain.
ELAINE: I got a date. Mr. Peterman walks up.
ELAINE: I got a pebble.
ELAINE: I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
ELAINE: I got him a two-line phone.
ELAINE: I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
ELAINE: I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
ELAINE: I got some for you.
ELAINE: I got the machine next, buddy. GREG: It's all yours.
ELAINE: I gotta go return something...
ELAINE: I gotta go talk to him.
ELAINE: I gotta go. New scene - Kramer and Karen at the hotel in Atlantic City. Karen is rehearsing her stage-walking with Kramer. She does it once, but Kramer isn't satisfied.
ELAINE: I gotta gooo...
ELAINE: I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
ELAINE: I guess I'll just--
ELAINE: I guess it was just a matter of time.
ELAINE: I guess it's you, Jer.
ELAINE: I guess that could work. At the tennis court concession stand. George is eating a sundae.
ELAINE: I guess this one is my fault.
ELAINE: I guess we could've called for help.
ELAINE: I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
ELAINE: I guess.
ELAINE: I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
ELAINE: I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
ELAINE: I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
ELAINE: I had the roast beef..
ELAINE: I had this dream last night and you were in it.
ELAINE: I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
ELAINE: I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her. They sit on the sofa.
ELAINE: I had to take it again.
ELAINE: I hate the counter.
ELAINE: I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
ELAINE: I hate this.
ELAINE: I have a personal commitment.
ELAINE: I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it.
ELAINE: I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
ELAINE: I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
ELAINE: I heard him contend that.
ELAINE: I heard you really inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
ELAINE: I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
ELAINE: I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
ELAINE: I just bought Jerry's couch for $50 dollars.
ELAINE: I just didn't know you watched that.
ELAINE: I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
ELAINE: I just finished working out are you busy?
ELAINE: I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
ELAINE: I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a
ELAINE: I just met him this morning.
ELAINE: I just said the same thing to you.
ELAINE: I just thought I could write it.
ELAINE: I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
ELAINE: I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
ELAINE: I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is. Puddy entering Monk's in a fur coat
ELAINE: I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... I just went to get popcorn, okay?
ELAINE: I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
ELAINE: I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
ELAINE: I know I know. That is so ahh ......
ELAINE: I know that but why are you going?
ELAINE: I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
ELAINE: I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
ELAINE: I know!
ELAINE: I know! Can you imagine that?
ELAINE: I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
ELAINE: I know, he has a real confidence problem.
ELAINE: I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
ELAINE: I know, I know, this is it.
ELAINE: I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.
ELAINE: I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
ELAINE: I know, it's just something you have to say...
ELAINE: I know, it's not that.
ELAINE: I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. You know,
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know. George enters
ELAINE: I know. I need a lesson.
ELAINE: I know. I woke up with this.
ELAINE: I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
ELAINE: I know. They're going in first with the last Bobka.
ELAINE: I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
ELAINE: I like Julie. She's very personable.
ELAINE: I loooove horse manure.
ELAINE: I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
ELAINE: I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
ELAINE: I love it. I'm getting it. Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.
ELAINE: I love shrimp! I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, and I will eat it until my stomach pops! Oh..
ELAINE: I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars ?
ELAINE: I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
ELAINE: I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
ELAINE: I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bushmen of the Kalahari.
ELAINE: I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
ELAINE: I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
ELAINE: I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
ELAINE: I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
ELAINE: I mean, stranger things have happened...
ELAINE: I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me,
ELAINE: I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
ELAINE: I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
ELAINE: I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life.
ELAINE: I met him.
ELAINE: I might be Elaine.
ELAINE: I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
ELAINE: I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
ELAINE: I need some space.
ELAINE: I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
ELAINE: I need to see Dr. Burke right away . This rash is spreading.
ELAINE: I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws
ELAINE: I never saw anyone play like that.
ELAINE: I never saw the statue.
ELAINE: I never should have given Anna the impression--
ELAINE: I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean enough.
ELAINE: I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
ELAINE: I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta be out by the end of the month.
ELAINE: I realize that.
ELAINE: I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
ELAINE: I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
ELAINE: I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
ELAINE: I respect that. Mmm, what happened?
ELAINE: I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
ELAINE: I said I'll take care of it!
ELAINE: I said it.
ELAINE: I said rubber fire .
ELAINE: I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
ELAINE: I said, yeah.
ELAINE: I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
ELAINE: I see you're still sticking with the denim. Do you have that card that I gave you?
ELAINE: I should have never left him alone .
ELAINE: I should..
ELAINE: I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
ELAINE: I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
ELAINE: I staked out his health club.
ELAINE: I still don't see what the big deal is.
ELAINE: I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
ELAINE: I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
ELAINE: I still smell!
ELAINE: I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
ELAINE: I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
ELAINE: I talked with the groom's parents..
ELAINE: I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
ELAINE: I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
ELAINE: I think he's got ideas.
ELAINE: I think I can tell.
ELAINE: I think I might. Mary Anne and George at George's new apartment.
ELAINE: I think I'll let you do it.
ELAINE: I think I'm gonna be sick.
ELAINE: I think it would be romantic.
ELAINE: I think it's a mistake.
ELAINE: I think it's B.O.!
ELAINE: I think it's great. I think you should get it.
ELAINE: I think it's unconscionable.
ELAINE: I think she'd figure it out.
ELAINE: I think so.
ELAINE: I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
ELAINE: I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't you?
ELAINE: I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself. --
ELAINE: I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window--
ELAINE: I though I'd never find it.
ELAINE: I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
ELAINE: I thought all guys do that.
ELAINE: I thought George was meeting us here?
ELAINE: I thought he was deported.
ELAINE: I thought he was Kramer's friend.
ELAINE: I thought I was alone.
ELAINE: I thought she was the one.
ELAINE: I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
ELAINE: I thought you had done this before.
ELAINE: I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
ELAINE: I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
ELAINE: I thought you were hungry.
ELAINE: I told ya'. He has ideas.
ELAINE: I told ya.
ELAINE: I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
ELAINE: I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
ELAINE: I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
ELAINE: I turned him. He defected.
ELAINE: I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
ELAINE: I want that free sub.
ELAINE: I want the one that I earned. I'll get it. I'll get it! H&H, and Elaine.
ELAINE: I want to be in on this, too.
ELAINE: I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time.
ELAINE: I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
ELAINE: I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis... Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.
ELAINE: I was at Bloomingdale's...waiting for the shower to heat up.
ELAINE: I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
ELAINE: I was just kiddin, around.......
ELAINE: I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
ELAINE: I was just trying to help you.
ELAINE: I was on the other line talking to Jill.
ELAINE: I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? Ahh.
ELAINE: I was the one who talked into your tape recorder. Jerry; I know, George told me.
ELAINE: I was with David Putty last night.
ELAINE: I went out with a a friend.
ELAINE: I went to visit him.
ELAINE: I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
ELAINE: I will.
ELAINE: I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. Â End of episode.
ELAINE: I wish I could quit...
ELAINE: I wish I was dead.
ELAINE: I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
ELAINE: I wish.
ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
ELAINE: I wonder what happened?
ELAINE: I work for your mail order catalog.
ELAINE: I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
ELAINE: I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
ELAINE: I wouldn't sign one.
ELAINE: I'd better not...
ELAINE: I'd do it but I don't have any money.
ELAINE: I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
ELAINE: I'll eat out.
ELAINE: I'll get it.
ELAINE: I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
ELAINE: I'll go if I don't have to talk.
ELAINE: I'll go to Paris.
ELAINE: I'll have the cinnamon Bobka.
ELAINE: I'll just have a glass of water.
ELAINE: I'll make a note of it. FRIEND 1: Hey, Kramer,
ELAINE: I'll see you later .
ELAINE: I'll see you tomorrow. Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady comes by.
ELAINE: I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
ELAINE: I'll take it!
ELAINE: I'll take it.
ELAINE: I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
ELAINE: I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
ELAINE: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
ELAINE: I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks , The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally
ELAINE: I'll try and remember that. Where's my meal? Passenger 1: He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats.
ELAINE: I'm afraid of dogs now.
ELAINE: I'm fine.
ELAINE: I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
ELAINE: I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
ELAINE: I'm going down there.
ELAINE: I'm going in .
ELAINE: I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?
ELAINE: I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
ELAINE: I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
ELAINE: I'm going to order Chinese Food.
ELAINE: I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
ELAINE: I'm going to that!
ELAINE: I'm gonna faint...
ELAINE: I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist.
ELAINE: I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
ELAINE: I'm good.
ELAINE: I'm just thinking about the question.
ELAINE: I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
ELAINE: I'm kinda full.
ELAINE: I'm leaving.
ELAINE: I'm marchin' in.
ELAINE: I'm marchin'.
ELAINE: I'm never eating here again.
ELAINE: I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
ELAINE: I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
ELAINE: I'm not gonna sleep with you.
ELAINE: I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
ELAINE: I'm not moving in.
ELAINE: I'm not saying anything.
ELAINE: I'm not so sure he wants one. Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o' clock.
ELAINE: I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
ELAINE: I'm not surprised.
ELAINE: I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
ELAINE: I'm okay, it's just a nick.
ELAINE: I'm on the phone here.
ELAINE: I'm queen of the castle.
ELAINE: I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
ELAINE: I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
ELAINE: I'm so sorry George
ELAINE: I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we're going to the Poconos on Friday, right honey?
ELAINE: I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act. Jerry pulls a stub of paper out of his wallet.
ELAINE: I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry OK? Bye-bye. .
ELAINE: I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I
ELAINE: I'm sorry you have to go.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
ELAINE: I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?
ELAINE: I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
ELAINE: I'm sorry... sorry.
ELAINE: I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
ELAINE: I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
ELAINE: I'm sure they're not.
ELAINE: I'm sure you'll have another fight, George.  Hold that thought!
ELAINE: I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
ELAINE: I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
ELAINE: I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the
ELAINE: I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
ELAINE: I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
ELAINE: I'm trying!
ELAINE: I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
ELAINE: I'm very imPRESSED? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
ELAINE: I'm waiting.
ELAINE: I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
ELAINE: I've always loved ... United Airlines.
ELAINE: I've been dying to see ``CheckMate''.
ELAINE: I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
ELAINE: I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
ELAINE: I've got an alarm, ok?
ELAINE: I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
ELAINE: I've got no room. Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, his hand shaking.
ELAINE: I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
ELAINE: I've got that magazine article for you.
ELAINE: I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
ELAINE: I've lost 6 pounds.
ELAINE: I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says Well, this is as far as I can take you.
ELAINE: I've never seen her before.
ELAINE: I've yada yada'd sex.
ELAINE: I, I think that's my button. You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
ELAINE: I... hate that woman.
ELAINE: I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
ELAINE: I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
ELAINE: I...I don't know...
ELAINE: Idiots! This is all yoru fault!
ELAINE: If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
ELAINE: If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
ELAINE: If I was saying something I would have said it.
ELAINE: If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too. George answering his phone, while still using the massage chair.
ELAINE: If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I
ELAINE: If only.
ELAINE: If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
ELAINE: If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
ELAINE: If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
ELAINE: If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
ELAINE: Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
ELAINE: Ilene.
ELAINE: In about twenty minutes. MR. PITT: Oh! Do I have time to change?
ELAINE: In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
ELAINE: In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
ELAINE: In the back.
ELAINE: In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
ELAINE: In the office.
ELAINE: India? Yeah, right. I'm goin' to India..
ELAINE: Insurance? You're charging me? Behind Elaine, George is standing in the open door
ELAINE: Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
ELAINE: Is George here?
ELAINE: Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
ELAINE: Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
ELAINE: Is it real butter?
ELAINE: Is that bad?
ELAINE: Is that good?
ELAINE: Is that the supermodel?
ELAINE: Is that tomorrow?
ELAINE: Is that with the parts and labor?
ELAINE: Is that..?
ELAINE: Is there a table ready? Restaurant Manager: How many?
ELAINE: Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't you hae coffee with people?
ELAINE: Is this gonna hurt?
ELAINE: Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
ELAINE: Isn't that a little...rash?
ELAINE: Isn't that blue car him?
ELAINE: Isnt' that..? Oh, is this fromt he snow last night? Ugh.. you know what you should've done? You should've turned it inside out.
ELAINE: IsnÂ’t that from your act, like, ten years ago?
ELAINE: It can be very frustrating.
ELAINE: It doesn't matter to me.
ELAINE: It doesn't matter.
ELAINE: It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
ELAINE: It ever happened! Understand?
ELAINE: It is funny.
ELAINE: It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
ELAINE: It is not necessary.
ELAINE: It is obtrusive, isn't it?
ELAINE: It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
ELAINE: It is..
ELAINE: It looks exactly like me.
ELAINE: It looks good.
ELAINE: It means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
ELAINE: It must be a mistake.
ELAINE: It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
ELAINE: It must've seeped up my subconscious , Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
ELAINE: It shrinks?
ELAINE: It smells like a rubber fire .
ELAINE: It took him like ten seconds!
ELAINE: It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing
ELAINE: It was a joke...
ELAINE: It was a little hair. I took it off.
ELAINE: It was an accident!
ELAINE: It was an accident.
ELAINE: It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week. (The menu at a neighboring table catches fire. Elaine quickly picks up a wine glass - about to put it out, but George tosses the menu on the floor, and stomps it out.
ELAINE: It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
ELAINE: It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
ELAINE: It was nothing, forget it.
ELAINE: It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
ELAINE: It was..uh.. John-John.
ELAINE: It works.
ELAINE: It wouldn't stop beeping in the car so Testikov through it out the window.
ELAINE: It's
ELAINE: It's a classic.
ELAINE: It's a hair.
ELAINE: It's a long story.
ELAINE: It's a new area code.
ELAINE: It's a page number.
ELAINE: It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
ELAINE: It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
ELAINE: It's an un-vitation! Hey, are you gettin' taller?
ELAINE: It's B.O. The valet must have had B.O.
ELAINE: It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
ELAINE: It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
ELAINE: It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
ELAINE: It's BOOKED Jerry!
ELAINE: It's brown!
ELAINE: It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
ELAINE: It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
ELAINE: It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
ELAINE: It's coming from my purse. It must be my new organizer, here.
ELAINE: It's dancing.
ELAINE: It's Elaine Marie Benes.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's for George.
ELAINE: It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
ELAINE: It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth. AT MONKS
ELAINE: It's gonna look great in your apartment, George.
ELAINE: It's great to... talk about... other people...
ELAINE: It's his birthday and it's his last day?
ELAINE: It's invisible.
ELAINE: It's ironic.
ELAINE: It's Joe Mayo's coat.
ELAINE: It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
ELAINE: It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
ELAINE: It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
ELAINE: It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
ELAINE: It's not a purse. It's European. Jerry sits down with Elaine.
ELAINE: It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
ELAINE: It's not bleak - it's springtime.
ELAINE: It's not just hair! Look!
ELAINE: It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
ELAINE: It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
ELAINE: It's not serious, is it?
ELAINE: It's not such a bad name.
ELAINE: It's nothing.
ELAINE: It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
ELAINE: It's possible.
ELAINE: It's really cold.
ELAINE: It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in the finals.
ELAINE: It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate.
ELAINE: It's that bad?
ELAINE: It's the next best thing to being alone.
ELAINE: It's time you got out a here anyway.
ELAINE: It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
ELAINE: It's up to you.
ELAINE: It's us.
ELAINE: It's Vegetable Lasagna.
ELAINE: It's your house.
ELAINE: It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
ELAINE: It... works!
ELAINE: Its the Urban Sombrero, I put it in the last catalog.
ELAINE: ItÂ’s disgusting.
ELAINE: ItÂ’s Elaine.
ELAINE: ItÂ’s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
ELAINE: ItÂ’s right down here to the left. I will meet you right back here.
ELAINE: ItÂ’s the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
ELAINE: ItÂ’s the same thing.
ELAINE: ItÂ’s you fault. You just got me thinking.
ELAINE: IÂ’ll be right back.
ELAINE: IÂ’ll hang the phone up right now!
ELAINE: IÂ’ll see ya.
ELAINE: IÂ’m doing great.
ELAINE: IÂ’m going to get some popcorn.
ELAINE: IÂ’m sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
ELAINE: IÂ’ve got nothing against the foot. IÂ’m pro-foot.
ELAINE: Jackie says put it on, Jerry.
ELAINE: Jackie says the top was faulty.
ELAINE: James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!
ELAINE: Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.

ELAINE: Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
ELAINE: Jerry, come on, you're doin' OK now, you should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live
ELAINE: Jerry, did you hear that? He couldn't eat for weeks...
ELAINE: Jerry, do I stink?
ELAINE: Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
ELAINE: Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
ELAINE: Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
ELAINE: Jerry, give him the keys back.
ELAINE: Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
ELAINE: Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
ELAINE: Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
ELAINE: Jerry, I'm on the other line.
ELAINE: Jerry, I've always loved ..u..
ELAINE: Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
ELAINE: Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
ELAINE: Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
ELAINE: Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back.

ELAINE: Jerry, my leg.
ELAINE: Jerry, talk to that guy again.
ELAINE: Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
ELAINE: Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
ELAINE: Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
ELAINE: Jerry, the man is a doctor.
ELAINE: Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They're in my short story class with Roxanne and me. Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!

ELAINE: Let me see this. You know what this is? This is a recipe

ELAINE: Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
ELAINE: Let's go.
ELAINE: Let's make it fifty.
ELAINE: Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
ELAINE: LetÂ’s face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? YouÂ’re not going to the ear guy.
ELAINE: Like ...humm...How did she sound?
ELAINE: Like we care if you go to the bathroom. Elaine and George, left alone together are obviously uncomfortable.
ELAINE: Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
ELAINE: Like... Like this?
ELAINE: Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
ELAINE: Listen David, IÂ’ve got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
ELAINE: Listen to me you little shi........
ELAINE: Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
ELAINE: Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
ELAINE: Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
ELAINE: Listen, Jerry can you do me a favour? Could you go into the room with me to visit him because I don't want him to think that I'm,
ELAINE: Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can't have soft cheese...
ELAINE: Listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
ELAINE: Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
ELAINE: Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
ELAINE: Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
ELAINE: Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
ELAINE: Listen, was Russell at the casting?
ELAINE: Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
ELAINE: Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
ELAINE: Lloyd, yes. Hello.
ELAINE: Look at George. He lucked out, huh?
ELAINE: Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made
ELAINE: Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
ELAINE: Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it? She moves so she can yell out the driver's open window.
ELAINE: Look at you. You're on a slant.
ELAINE: Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
ELAINE: Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on.
ELAINE: Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
ELAINE: Look! Look at...look at this! There's a garden.
ELAINE: Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
ELAINE: Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
ELAINE: Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
ELAINE: Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
ELAINE: Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long of time.
ELAINE: Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
ELAINE: Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool! MR. PITT: Where is it?
ELAINE: Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
ELAINE: Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
ELAINE: Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. I mean, it's a girl's bike.
ELAINE: Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
ELAINE: Lou! In here! We have to talk.
ELAINE: Love newton?
ELAINE: Maestro huh? OK
ELAINE: Maestro!
ELAINE: Make it clear?
ELAINE: Make it ten.
ELAINE: Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?
ELAINE: Man, Kramer! I could kill him.
ELAINE: Manuscript?
ELAINE: Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
ELAINE: Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
ELAINE: Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
ELAINE: May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
ELAINE: Maybe coffee was coffee.
ELAINE: Maybe I should just get married.
ELAINE: Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties and they're - all laid out for me.
ELAINE: Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
ELAINE: Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.
ELAINE: Maybe it's the cold weather.
ELAINE: Maybe IÂ’ll get a steak with french fried onion wings.
ELAINE: Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?
ELAINE: Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
ELAINE: Maybe we could all have dinner later?
ELAINE: Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
ELAINE: Maybe we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
ELAINE: Maybe we're too close to the bottle. Jerry's buzzer buzzes.
ELAINE: Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
ELAINE: Maybe.
ELAINE: Maybe.. All over your face!
ELAINE: Me either.
ELAINE: Me too.
ELAINE: Me too.

ELAINE: No! (a fight starts between Elaine and George; Elaine ends up taking off
ELAINE: No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
ELAINE: No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
ELAINE: No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
ELAINE: No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving
ELAINE: No! I won't be a party to this.
ELAINE: No! I won't!
ELAINE: No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
ELAINE: No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick
ELAINE: No! ItÂ’s an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
ELAINE: No! Jerry! Jerry!
ELAINE: No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
ELAINE: No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
ELAINE: No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn't have wooden teeth, you did!

ELAINE: No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... conversation.
ELAINE: No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
ELAINE: No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges. Yes, this is my attorney.
ELAINE: No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
ELAINE: No, because I slept with my back to him.
ELAINE: No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
ELAINE: No, but I exercised that day.
ELAINE: No, but there was nobody sitting here...
ELAINE: No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with a lesser Bobka.
ELAINE: No, Castro.
ELAINE: No, Chinese.
ELAINE: No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
ELAINE: No, George, this is the ticket- line.
ELAINE: No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
ELAINE: No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
ELAINE: No, he wants to torture me. (CUT TO: later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.
ELAINE: No, he's driving back to Maryland tonight.
ELAINE: No, he's not.
ELAINE: No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
ELAINE: No, I can't. DR. RESTON :You can and you will.
ELAINE: No, I didn't hear anything. Oh, my God, look who's here.
ELAINE: No, I don't think so.
ELAINE: No, I don't want this anymore.
ELAINE: No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
ELAINE: No, I got caught.
ELAINE: No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
ELAINE: No, I guess you couldn't have..
ELAINE: No, I just have a cold.
ELAINE: No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit.
ELAINE: No, I just..
ELAINE: No, I mentioned the bisk.
ELAINE: No, I really don't want to.
ELAINE: No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
ELAINE: No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job. Mr. VISAKI: Have you ever waited on tables before.
ELAINE: No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
ELAINE: No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm going out with -
ELAINE: No, I'm not. Here you go.
ELAINE: No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ...
ELAINE: No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
ELAINE: No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a break from my roommate.
ELAINE: No, I'm sure you do.
ELAINE: No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
ELAINE: No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
ELAINE: No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
ELAINE: No, it's not going to work with this guy.
ELAINE: No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't seen my father in a while and.. you know.
ELAINE: No, milk.
ELAINE: No, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask them. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
ELAINE: No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
ELAINE: No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
ELAINE: No, no no.
ELAINE: No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
ELAINE: No, no, I guarantee it.
ELAINE: No, no, I just don't see how that's relevant. DR. RESTON: It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.
ELAINE: No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
ELAINE: No, no, I'm leaving.
ELAINE: No, no, it does!
ELAINE: No, no, it's okay. Rabbi: My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps
ELAINE: No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
ELAINE: No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
ELAINE: No, no, no! It can't be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
ELAINE: No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
ELAINE: No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
ELAINE: No, no, no, no, no, these are good. Listen, listen: You ran out of underwear, you can't leave the house.
ELAINE: No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
ELAINE: No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
ELAINE: No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
ELAINE: No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
ELAINE: No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. this.
ELAINE: No, no, no. You give me your number.
ELAINE: No, no, unfocus. MR. PITT: I am unfocused!
ELAINE: No, no.
ELAINE: No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
ELAINE: No, no. I'm fine.
ELAINE: No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry. Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg.
ELAINE: No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
ELAINE: No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
ELAINE: No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
ELAINE: No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
ELAINE: No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence.
ELAINE: No, No...
ELAINE: No, No....Yesss!!!!!!
ELAINE: No, not at all...
ELAINE: No, nothing.
ELAINE: No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God!
ELAINE: No, really. TOBY: Really? You think so?
ELAINE: No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
ELAINE: No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
ELAINE: No, sir, I can't.
ELAINE: No, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
ELAINE: No, TAKEN, Taken, taken.
ELAINE: No, thanks.
ELAINE: No, that would be too noisy.
ELAINE: No, that's a big coincidence.
ELAINE: No, that's not it!
ELAINE: No, that's not your coat.
ELAINE: No, that's too much money to borrow.
ELAINE: No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner-theater production of a Chorus Line. So, now all day
ELAINE: No, there are degrees of coincidences.
ELAINE: No, these are saved.
ELAINE: No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
ELAINE: No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -
ELAINE: No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me! The florist notices what he's done and turns off the hose.
ELAINE: No, we just met...
ELAINE: No, we've already got this. I'll just take it off.
ELAINE: No, what?
ELAINE: No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
ELAINE: No, you can't be trusted!
ELAINE: No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?! MR. PITT: Hmm, what's happened to me? When's the meeting?
ELAINE: No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, Quite a workout.
ELAINE: No, you look pale.
ELAINE: No, you're the only white poet warlord in the neighborhood.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.

ELAINE: No. A general guy.
ELAINE: No. Do you ever think about it?
ELAINE: No. He said I didn't need a shot.
ELAINE: No. I can't smell it.
ELAINE: No. I don't want him looking.
ELAINE: No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
ELAINE: No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
ELAINE: No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything. Jerry picks up the bottle and shakes it gently.
ELAINE: No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
ELAINE: No. In what way?
ELAINE: No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here. EXT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
ELAINE: No. Let me see that. Don't-mess-with-Johnny.
ELAINE: No. Me neither.

ELAINE: No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
ELAINE: No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say get out of here. I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
ELAINE: No. You are not a man. It takes a long time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
ELAINE: No. You got the wrong number, kid.
ELAINE: No. Your.
ELAINE: No....Oh No....
ELAINE: No?
ELAINE: No? The doctor hands Elaine the chart, she looks at it in astonishment.

ELAINE: Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
ELAINE: Now listen, tell me something. When are you gettin out of here?
ELAINE: Now listen. I just donÂ’t know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
ELAINE: Now those look good, they're very bold.
ELAINE: Now what was that ? George at Newman's apartment
ELAINE: Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
ELAINE: Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?

ELAINE: Of course I'd pay you back..
ELAINE: Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.

ELAINE: Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.

ELAINE: Oh fine, I donÂ’t like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
ELAINE: Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will not stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.

ELAINE: Oh, he's...he's a joy...

ELAINE: Oh, how do you do. Elaine Benes.
ELAINE: Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my Atomic Sub card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
ELAINE: Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
ELAINE: Oh, I can't Jerry:. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
ELAINE: Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't remember them.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't think that's possible.
ELAINE: Oh, I donÂ’t know..
ELAINE: Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
ELAINE: Oh, I know! It is awful!
ELAINE: Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies..
ELAINE: Oh, I love cashmere.
ELAINE: Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
ELAINE: Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
ELAINE: Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
ELAINE: Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
ELAINE: Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm not very good.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm not, uh...
ELAINE: Oh, I'm really uncomfortable talking about this. DR. RESTON: Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm so sorry.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry. I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question.
ELAINE: Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending the weekend together?
ELAINE: Oh, it was a frame-up.
ELAINE: Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.
ELAINE: Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes nowhere.
ELAINE: Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
ELAINE: Oh, it's been a while.
ELAINE: Oh, it's coming in already! Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
ELAINE: Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
ELAINE: Oh, Jeffrey.
ELAINE: Oh, Jerry!
ELAINE: Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
ELAINE: Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, uh, five bucks? At Jerry's apartment.
ELAINE: Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
ELAINE: Oh, look at this!
ELAINE: Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful. Oh, you poor, frail dear... On the bright side, Kramer and George arrive at the airport. They're running to the terminal:
ELAINE: Oh, lovely...

ELAINE: Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
ELAINE: Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.
ELAINE: Oh, no, no no no, I can't do that. DR. RESTON :You can do it and you will do it.
ELAINE: Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
ELAINE: Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good becasue we've got choir practice.
ELAINE: Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... Oh, you got cookies!

ELAINE: Oh, oh, OK You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
ELAINE: Oh, ok!
ELAINE: Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
ELAINE: Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
ELAINE: Oh, please.
ELAINE: Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
ELAINE: Oh, probably caught in traffic.
ELAINE: Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this
ELAINE: Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He's the one who got me the apartment.

ELAINE: Right on baby.

ELAINE: Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
ELAINE: Right! In fact... No, never mind...
ELAINE: Right!!
ELAINE: Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
ELAINE: Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
ELAINE: Right, well...
ELAINE: Right.
ELAINE: Right.
ELAINE: Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
ELAINE: Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe.
ELAINE: Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
ELAINE: Right. Yeah. Could I have a small popcorn?
ELAINE: Ring Dings? GEORGE: Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you'll ever get at a bakery.

ELAINE: Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor's studio so we can't go there. It's really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won't even go away fro the
ELAINE: Roy!
ELAINE: Run down your case for me again...?
ELAINE: Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work . So...

ELAINE: Sara Sitarides?
ELAINE: Saturday night with your parents . Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
ELAINE: Saturday.
ELAINE: Sauce me.
ELAINE: Say what? Say what?
ELAINE: Seattle.

ELAINE: See ya'.
ELAINE: See ya.
ELAINE: See'ya.
ELAINE: See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
ELAINE: See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
ELAINE: See, right here you wrote Myra had the baby, but you didn't use an exclamation point.
ELAINE: See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
ELAINE: See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
ELAINE: See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
ELAINE: See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
ELAINE: See, this is what JerryÂ’s doesnÂ’t understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnÂ’t mean we are back together.
ELAINE: See, what did I tell ya?
ELAINE: See? Finally, finally I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
ELAINE: See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
ELAINE: Seems to be.
ELAINE: Shall I undo it?
ELAINE: She did? Oh, that's so great!
ELAINE: She didn't ask me what I wanted.
ELAINE: She died!
ELAINE: She died?!
ELAINE: She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
ELAINE: She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
ELAINE: She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
ELAINE: She sent you a Christmas card?
ELAINE: She stopped performing.
ELAINE: She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
ELAINE: She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
ELAINE: She's not... and the guy just took off. Don't say anything to anybody.
ELAINE: She's on the lease!...George you have got to find an other place for me.
ELAINE: She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
ELAINE: She.
ELAINE: She.. was.
ELAINE: She...likes you..

ELAINE: Shut up, George.
ELAINE: Shut up. Shut up! Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have you been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg. Cut back to Jerry and George.
ELAINE: Shut up...
ELAINE: Sigh/Ugh.
ELAINE: Since when do you wear cologne?
ELAINE: Since when is a drain a toilet?!
ELAINE: Since when?
ELAINE: Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
ELAINE: So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
ELAINE: So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
ELAINE: So did you hear this message?
ELAINE: So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
ELAINE: So how long did they drag you?
ELAINE: So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
ELAINE: So how's it going with my friend?
ELAINE: So humm....When you gonna call her?
ELAINE: So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway. George, taking out his wallet to pay the check.
ELAINE: So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
ELAINE: So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
ELAINE: So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
ELAINE: So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon, what am I gonna do?
ELAINE: So I'm not gonna be an usher?
ELAINE: So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
ELAINE: So it wasn't a bomb .
ELAINE: So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
ELAINE: So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
ELAINE: So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
ELAINE: So nothing... Nothing...
ELAINE: So now Duncan is back?
ELAINE: So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
ELAINE: So now the other Lippman kissed me.
ELAINE: So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
ELAINE: So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
ELAINE: So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
ELAINE: So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me: Do you wanna split a cab uptown?
ELAINE: So they don't want a baby?
ELAINE: So this is never gonna stop?
ELAINE: So we can go anywhere we want?
ELAINE: So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
ELAINE: So we're having dinner tonight?
ELAINE: So what are their plans?
ELAINE: So what are you going to do?
ELAINE: So what are your parents doing here in new York?
ELAINE: So what did he have to say?
ELAINE: So what did he say?
ELAINE: So what did you say?
ELAINE: So what do you have to say for yourself?
ELAINE: So what do you want me to do?
ELAINE: So what happened?
ELAINE: So what movie are you guys seeing ?
ELAINE: So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
ELAINE: So what're you gonna do?
ELAINE: So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
ELAINE: So what?
ELAINE: So what?
ELAINE: So what?
ELAINE: So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
ELAINE: So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
ELAINE: So when are we gonna eat?
ELAINE: So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
ELAINE: So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
ELAINE: So who's playing Elaine?
ELAINE: So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
ELAINE: So you cna't do both?
ELAINE: So you consider this a relationship?
ELAINE: So you say.
ELAINE: So you're concerned.
ELAINE: So you're giving him a discount too?
ELAINE: So, 10 to 14 months.
ELAINE: So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
ELAINE: So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
ELAINE: So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
ELAINE: So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
ELAINE: So, George, I still donÂ’t understand - how was that a setup?
ELAINE: So, George... did you get the chair?
ELAINE: So, get this: Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
ELAINE: So, how did it end?
ELAINE: So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
ELAINE: So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
ELAINE: So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
ELAINE: So, I haven't seen you in a while.
ELAINE: So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?
ELAINE: So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
ELAINE: So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
ELAINE: So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
ELAINE: So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
ELAINE: So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
ELAINE: So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
ELAINE: So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
ELAINE: So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
ELAINE: So, she fell?
ELAINE: So, that's the situation.
ELAINE: So, that's why we're not togeter anymore.
ELAINE: So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
ELAINE: So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request..
ELAINE: So, the only reason..
ELAINE: So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
ELAINE: So, waddya' going to do?
ELAINE: So, what do you think? PITT: No.
ELAINE: So, what's that?

ELAINE: So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
ELAINE: So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
ELAINE: So? What do you want me to do about it? Mr. Lippman: You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.
ELAINE: So? What happened?
ELAINE: Some dinner, huh?
ELAINE: Some friend of his from England.
ELAINE: Some house, huh?

ELAINE: Stop the fight! GEORGE: Tamale!
ELAINE: Street toughs took my armoire?

ELAINE: Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
ELAINE: Superman can go back in time?
ELAINE: Sure - the video.
ELAINE: Sure, fine.
ELAINE: Sure, it's...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
ELAINE: Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?

ELAINE: Thank you..
ELAINE: Thank-you.
ELAINE: Thanks
ELAINE: Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
ELAINE: Thanks for the dinner .
ELAINE: Thanks for the re-fill.

ELAINE: That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
ELAINE: That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
ELAINE: That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
ELAINE: That is not the point.
ELAINE: That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
ELAINE: That is so ridiculous.
ELAINE: That is so stupid. Why don't you just confess?
ELAINE: That is so true! Although one wonders if War and Peace would has been as highly acclaimed as it was if it was published under it's
ELAINE: That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
ELAINE: That was good. That was very good.
ELAINE: That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.

ELAINE: That was two months ago.
ELAINE: That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
ELAINE: That will be fun.
ELAINE: That's a good idea.
ELAINE: That's a pretty big tip...
ELAINE: That's a rat hat?
ELAINE: That's at the airport, right?
ELAINE: That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again. She pays and gets out again.
ELAINE: That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
ELAINE: That's fantastic.
ELAINE: That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
ELAINE: That's great George.
ELAINE: That's her. That's her. Jerry holds up his hands, indicating he wants a few seconds to prepare.
ELAINE: That's impossible...

ELAINE: That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
ELAINE: That's ridiculous. GEORGE: That's Kramer.
ELAINE: That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
ELAINE: That's right! He's a real sidler.
ELAINE: That's sounds pretty juvenile.
ELAINE: That's stealing?
ELAINE: That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
ELAINE: That's the emergency?
ELAINE: That's us.
ELAINE: That's what I said .
ELAINE: That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
ELAINE: ThatÂ’s right. High-five! On the flip side! TakinÂ’ me to ArbyÂ’s..
ELAINE: The astronauts use them.

ELAINE: The balance beam?
ELAINE: The black and white?
ELAINE: The book is great. Did you go out last night?
ELAINE: The CABIN is on fire!

ELAINE: The one you broke the plans with tonight?
ELAINE: The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you. Jerry Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, how soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am going. Okay, see you in five minutes.
ELAINE: The other guy.
ELAINE: The other guy?!

ELAINE: The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
ELAINE: Then how are all these people getting together?
ELAINE: Then how come we're not moving?
ELAINE: Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
ELAINE: Then maybe you have a fax machine.
ELAINE: Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash .
ELAINE: Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
ELAINE: Then why are we calling?
ELAINE: Then why did you print it. Mr. Elinoff: I liked the kitty.
ELAINE: Then why didn't you take it? Passenger 3: I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot.
ELAINE: Then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
ELAINE: Then, after a period of being there for you, we slowly remove the two words for you, and we're just there.
ELAINE: There are plenty of things to say.
ELAINE: There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
ELAINE: There he is.
ELAINE: There is no he.
ELAINE: There is no park and the team has relocated.

ELAINE: There's no Rubber Man.
ELAINE: There's no time.

ELAINE: There's Rachel.
ELAINE: There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
ELAINE: There, we just talked business.
ELAINE: These are terrible .
ELAINE: These aren't my keys!
ELAINE: These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
ELAINE: These heals are so uneven.
ELAINE: These Kramer stories are unusable! I mean, some of them aren't even stories! Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
ELAINE: These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
ELAINE: These things happen
ELAINE: These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go!
ELAINE: They all are..
ELAINE: They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away. Newman enters.

ELAINE: They drove away?
ELAINE: They have a big salad.
ELAINE: They have big salads.
ELAINE: They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
ELAINE: They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
ELAINE: They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
ELAINE: They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
ELAINE: They rehearse all the time?
ELAINE: They should be here today.
ELAINE: They want five thousand dollars now.
ELAINE: They were stolen.
ELAINE: They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.

ELAINE: They're dying in the nets.
ELAINE: They're gettin' divorced!
ELAINE: They're going to be heroes.

ELAINE: This car.
ELAINE: This chicken is really good.
ELAINE: This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
ELAINE: This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me. Passenger: I can here you.
ELAINE: This is Aaron.
ELAINE: This is all very exciting.
ELAINE: This is an absolute disaster.
ELAINE: This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
ELAINE: This is it. I can take this anymore.
ELAINE: This is it. Wish me luck.
ELAINE: This is my bike! Newman brakes to a halt in front of Elaine.
ELAINE: This is nice .
ELAINE: This is nice. What kind of car is this?
ELAINE: This is not the point. The point is, you just can't have the bike.
ELAINE: This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.
ELAINE: THIS is what you came up with?
ELAINE: This is... uh... you really lost weight.
ELAINE: This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 3:30 this morning.
ELAINE: This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
ELAINE: This was my idea you stole my idea. Mr. Lippman: Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.
ELAINE: This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
ELAINE: Thought it would be nice.
ELAINE: Three days.
ELAINE: Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
ELAINE: Three hundred a month? Oh my God.
ELAINE: Tia? Who's that?
ELAINE: Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
ELAINE: To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
ELAINE: To please Mr. Pitt.
ELAINE: To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.
ELAINE: Todd.

ELAINE: Too tight?
ELAINE: Top of the Muffin to you!? Mr. Lippman: Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
ELAINE: Toxic waste green.
ELAINE: Try it on. Wow, this is soft suede.
ELAINE: Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
ELAINE: Tuna?
ELAINE: Turn your alarm off!!
ELAINE: Twenty sponges should be plenty.
ELAINE: Twenty-five percent.
ELAINE: Two, three hundred?
ELAINE: Ugghh.
ELAINE: Ugh!
ELAINE: Ugh!
ELAINE: Ugh! You are kidding me.
ELAINE: Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
ELAINE: Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
ELAINE: Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
ELAINE: Ugh, the hell with 'em. Wendy and Elaine share a laugh. Wendy then starts to pull the car over

ELAINE: Uh, don't worry, he's cool.
ELAINE: Uh, great!
ELAINE: uh, ha.
ELAINE: Uh, his name, uh, Idon't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer. DR. RESTON: Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?
ELAINE: Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
ELAINE: Uh, I guess I hadn't--
ELAINE: Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
ELAINE: Uh, it's a riot Alice.
ELAINE: Uh, kind of.
ELAINE: Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
ELAINE: Uh, Kramer...
ELAINE: Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
ELAINE: Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. . I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
ELAINE: Uh, Mr. Pitt... MR. PITT: Yes?
ELAINE: Uh, no ... take it.
ELAINE: Uh, no, I'm OK.

ELAINE: Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
ELAINE: Uh, thanks.
ELAINE: Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
ELAINE: Uh, thats, ...
ELAINE: Uh, to a restaurant.
ELAINE: Uh, uh.
ELAINE: Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
ELAINE: Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.
ELAINE: Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
ELAINE: Uh, you have to work like that?
ELAINE: Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
ELAINE: Uh-huh

ELAINE: uh.
ELAINE: Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
ELAINE: Uh..
ELAINE: Uh.. that doesnÂ’t make any sense. I am leaving.
ELAINE: Uh... I... A voice calls from across the street.
ELAINE: Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
ELAINE: Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.
ELAINE: Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
ELAINE: Uhh. I guess so. Why?
ELAINE: Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
ELAINE: Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
ELAINE: Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?
ELAINE: uhn... Sorry!
ELAINE: Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
ELAINE: Um ,nothing.
ELAINE: Um uh.
ELAINE: Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine?
ELAINE: Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
ELAINE: Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
ELAINE: Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
ELAINE: Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
ELAINE: Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.
ELAINE: Um, no. MR. PITT: Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.
ELAINE: Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
ELAINE: Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni.
ELAINE: Um, okay, we got the cake now. Where are George and Kramer?
ELAINE: Um, there's a just... MR. PITT: Is that ink?
ELAINE: Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
ELAINE: Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
ELAINE: Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
ELAINE: Um, what's the difference? DR. RESTON: Are you afraid to tell me his name?
ELAINE: Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. He accompanied me, ya know, single woman alone in a big city could be dangerous.
ELAINE: Um, you know Greg, I...
ELAINE: Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed his spirits.
ELAINE: Um. Kramer!
ELAINE: Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
ELAINE: Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
ELAINE: Um...as far as I know.
ELAINE: Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
ELAINE: Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
ELAINE: unbridled enthusiasm...?
ELAINE: Unless you're married to a dictator..
ELAINE: Uuuhm, all the time.
ELAINE: Vanessa.
ELAINE: Vegetable Lasagna!
ELAINE: Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
ELAINE: Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
ELAINE: Very much.
ELAINE: Very near.
ELAINE: Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
ELAINE: Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...
ELAINE: Vivian...
ELAINE: W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
ELAINE: Wa',you don't have the directions?
ELAINE: Waddya' write?
ELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has never been with a man her
ELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
ELAINE: Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
ELAINE: Wait until I get my hands on that George. I'm going to pull that big hood over his little head, tie the string and suffocate him. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
ELAINE: Wait up!
ELAINE: Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
ELAINE: Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
ELAINE: Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.

ELAINE: Walnuts, mmmmmm.
ELAINE: Wanna sit down?
ELAINE: Want to go get something to eat?
ELAINE: War-- What is it go for?!
ELAINE: Was it my fault?
ELAINE: Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just instinct?
ELAINE: Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
ELAINE: Watch out for that maroon Golf.
ELAINE: Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last
ELAINE: We are...
ELAINE: We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
ELAINE: We can't ask him...
ELAINE: We certainly have.
ELAINE: We did. We're just hanging out.
ELAINE: We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
ELAINE: We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
ELAINE: We have to break up.
ELAINE: We just got along so great.
ELAINE: We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
ELAINE: We know what a face consists of. Janet arrives
ELAINE: We made plans.
ELAINE: We never dated in winter.
ELAINE: We should be able to get across right through here! She lifts the nylon flap to find a brick wall.
ELAINE: We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
ELAINE: We talked about that already.
ELAINE: We waited fifteen minutes for this. Oh. YOU SOLD ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing are you going to wait here?
ELAINE: We were just trying to help.
ELAINE: We'll get some cake. Can you stop off at the bakery?
ELAINE: We'll have to sleep head to toe.
ELAINE: We'll see it Sunday. George enters.
ELAINE: We're doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
ELAINE: We're down here! Help!
ELAINE: We're engaged?
ELAINE: We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
ELAINE: We're not going to sit together?
ELAINE: We're straightening out?
ELAINE: We've got a good team.

ELAINE: Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
ELAINE: Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?
ELAINE: Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......
ELAINE: Well at least let George do it!
ELAINE: Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a one woman man, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his
ELAINE: Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
ELAINE: Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
ELAINE: Well come here and take a look.
ELAINE: Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
ELAINE: Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
ELAINE: Well do you see it or don't you?
ELAINE: Well done.
ELAINE: Well eh, kind of....
ELAINE: Well he frightened me.
ELAINE: Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same
ELAINE: Well how about a carrot cake?
ELAINE: Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
ELAINE: Well I didn't know.
ELAINE: Well I don't care. It was delicious.
ELAINE: Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
ELAINE: Well I figured that's what couples do.
ELAINE: Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
ELAINE: Well I trust people not to do that.
ELAINE: Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
ELAINE: Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
ELAINE: Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
ELAINE: Well if it's not a date then what is it ?
ELAINE: Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea. Mr. Lippman: You want a muffin or not?
ELAINE: Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
ELAINE: Well it did occur to me.
ELAINE: Well it was easy. Really.
ELAINE: Well it's , it's ..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I
ELAINE: Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have hit the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
ELAINE: Well it's nothing I planned on happeniong, you knoe. It just kind of happened. DR. RESTON: Tell me about him.
ELAINE: Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
ELAINE: Well Jerry told me that you did.
ELAINE: Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
ELAINE: Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
ELAINE: Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
ELAINE: Well listen I'm going to do you want me to stop by?
ELAINE: Well maybe I feel the same way.
ELAINE: Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care. To Jerry's place , Kramer is already there making himself a lunch.
ELAINE: Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
ELAINE: Well maybe you should ask him!
ELAINE: Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.
ELAINE: Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses are obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
ELAINE: Well not quite.
ELAINE: Well some people drink coffee that late.
ELAINE: Well stop being such a baby.
ELAINE: Well that's not sex.
ELAINE: Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
ELAINE: Well the question isnÂ’t even for me itÂ’s for a friend.
ELAINE: Well then what ?
ELAINE: Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
ELAINE: Well they're perfectly edible.
ELAINE: Well we can take the car service from my office.
ELAINE: Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier ,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
ELAINE: Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
ELAINE: Well what do you want to give him, change?
ELAINE: Well what happened when you raced him again?
ELAINE: Well where is it, give it to me!

ELAINE: Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
ELAINE: Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
ELAINE: Well you know George. It's not enough to get there. you gotta make good time.
ELAINE: Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
ELAINE: Well you're not Super Man.
ELAINE: Well,
ELAINE: Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
ELAINE: Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... you don't want to go to... that... no.
ELAINE: Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
ELAINE: Well, actually I do have a bill here, if you could just sign this expense, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
ELAINE: Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
ELAINE: Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
ELAINE: Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
ELAINE: Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me big head.
ELAINE: Well, are you going to take a nap or --
ELAINE: Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. So what do you think?
ELAINE: Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
ELAINE: Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
ELAINE: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
ELAINE: Well, did he say that?
ELAINE: Well, for me it's a step up. It's like moving from Island to Finland.
ELAINE: Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I'm going to sidle the sidler.
ELAINE: Well, Fred asked me out.
ELAINE: Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
ELAINE: Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
ELAINE: Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
ELAINE: Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the swirl!
ELAINE: Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
ELAINE: Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. He's a city marshal. He's towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car!
ELAINE: Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
ELAINE: Well, he's getting credit for work I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
ELAINE: Well, Here we are.
ELAINE: Well, how are we gonna do it?
ELAINE: Well, how could he do that?
ELAINE: Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
ELAINE: Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
ELAINE: Well, I --
ELAINE: Well, I am the President.
ELAINE: Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
ELAINE: Well, I couldn't help it. Moland Spring? MR. PITT: I like the name Moland. I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!
ELAINE: Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
ELAINE: Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
ELAINE: Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know about gold.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
ELAINE: Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head for? KURT: About three years.
ELAINE: Well, I felt a call for one.
ELAINE: Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
ELAINE: Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It has been a few years.
ELAINE: Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
ELAINE: Well, I guess we'll just Hey, just gimme that.
ELAINE: Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. What?
ELAINE: Well, I have no intention of getting grace.
ELAINE: Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy.

ELAINE: Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
ELAINE: Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.

ELAINE: You know, it's not really that terrible.
ELAINE: You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
ELAINE: You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
ELAINE: You know, Kenny Rogers has a- Jerry's maid exits from his bedroom and walks over to the kitchen.
ELAINE: You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.

ELAINE: You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
ELAINE: You know, we should say something.
ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
ELAINE: You know.. the spirit world.
ELAINE: You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
ELAINE: You know...the move.
ELAINE: You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
ELAINE: You lie.
ELAINE: You look a little stressed.
ELAINE: You look ridiculous in that thing.
ELAINE: You look terrific.
ELAINE: You made a man cry? I've never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn't cry.. I got the cab.
ELAINE: You mean lying to your uncle?
ELAINE: You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
ELAINE: You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...

ELAINE: You never get good haircuts.
ELAINE: You never know...

ELAINE: You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
ELAINE: You should run for mayor.

ESTELLE: Are you trying to get rid of us?
ESTELLE: Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
ESTELLE: Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
ESTELLE: But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
ESTELLE: But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
ESTELLE: Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
ESTELLE: Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
ESTELLE: Did he say Assman?

ESTELLE: He told you he liked it?
ESTELLE: Hello Seinfelds.
ESTELLE: Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
ESTELLE: Here, here's the bra.
ESTELLE: How could they have plans?
ESTELLE: How much is there?!
ESTELLE: I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
ESTELLE: I am not giving him a bra.
ESTELLE: I am, too!
ESTELLE: I can't believe you're moving out. Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
ESTELLE: I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there. MRS. ROSS: If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, I'd

ESTELLE: I hate that old door. Throw it out!
ESTELLE: I heard noise.
ESTELLE: I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?

ESTELLE: I told you to fix that thing.
ESTELLE: I told you. Here, think you know everything?
ESTELLE: I want to know what youÂ’re doing in there.
ESTELLE: I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
ESTELLE: I want you to go see somebody.
ESTELLE: I'll try to be more careful.
ESTELLE: I'm not betting!
ESTELLE: I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
ESTELLE: I'm sorry.
ESTELLE: It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
ESTELLE: It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
ESTELLE: It's junk.
ESTELLE: It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
ESTELLE: It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
ESTELLE: Jerry, did you hear this?
ESTELLE: Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.

ESTELLE: Leave him alone!
ESTELLE: Maybe they don't like us.
ESTELLE: Maybe you should take a civil service test.
ESTELLE: Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it? MRS. ROSS: Oh, mother.
ESTELLE: More stuff?!
ESTELLE: Move your crap, I'm comin' in!
ESTELLE: Nah, not interested.
ESTELLE: No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
ESTELLE: Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
ESTELLE: Oh my goodness.
ESTELLE: Oh!
ESTELLE: Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
ESTELLE: Oh, I can't help it!
ESTELLE: Oh, I don't care.
ESTELLE: Oh, I was so worried.
ESTELLE: Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
ESTELLE: Oh, my God!
ESTELLE: Oh, okay. Dr. Bakersoll: Now, is someone coming to pick you up?
ESTELLE: Oh, really?
ESTELLE: Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
ESTELLE: Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
ESTELLE: Ohh.. thank you, Maestro.
ESTELLE: People take buses to get that rye.
ESTELLE: Phil Casacof?
ESTELLE: Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
ESTELLE: Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
ESTELLE: Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
ESTELLE: So George, why are you here?
ESTELLE: So what are you gonna do?!
ESTELLE: So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.

ESTELLE: So, how are ya, Jerry?
ESTELLE: So, I'm getting an eye job.
ESTELLE: So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.
ESTELLE: So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
ESTELLE: Sorry to bother you, Judge.
ESTELLE: Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
ESTELLE: Stop squirming.
ESTELLE: Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
ESTELLE: Tell it to the audience. Here, I made some bologna sandwiches.
ESTELLE: That's as far as it goes.
ESTELLE: The first game?!
ESTELLE: The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
ESTELLE: The NBC guy liked it?
ESTELLE: The proctologist? Are you okay?
ESTELLE: They picked up the show?
ESTELLE: This is the only time the doctor has.
ESTELLE: Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
ESTELLE: Uh, Bakersoll.
ESTELLE: We forgot to bring it in.
ESTELLE: We're moving to Florida. George: What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm
ESTELLE: Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
ESTELLE: Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.

ESTELLE: Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
ESTELLE: Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
ESTELLE: Well, I'm out there, George.
ESTELLE: Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
ESTELLE: Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
ESTELLE: Well, what are you doing?
ESTELLE: What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
ESTELLE: What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
ESTELLE: What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.
ESTELLE: What does he want with your swim trunks?
ESTELLE: What extremities?
ESTELLE: What's going on in here? Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
ESTELLE: What's this.
ESTELLE: Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
ESTELLE: Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
ESTELLE: Why can't we sit over there?
ESTELLE: Why canÂ’t you do anything like a normal person?
ESTELLE: Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
ESTELLE: Yeah, what is it?
ESTELLE: Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
ESTELLE: You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
ESTELLE: You donÂ’t feel well?
ESTELLE: You got ketchup on it! George takes his plate and the ketchup and leaves.
ESTELLE: You know
ESTELLE: You know how to write?
ESTELLE: You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
ESTELLE: You think they're coming tonight?
ESTELLE: You're back.
ESTELLE: You're late!
ESTELLE: You're not giving away our Waterpik!
ESTELLE: You're not gonna give away that water pik!

FARKUS: See you monday 9 o'clock.
FARKUS: So, basically the job here is quite simple. Selling bras.
FARKUS: That's incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres.
FARKUS: This is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. He's supposed to start on monday. Ms. De Granmont: If he's here on monday, you're not. Take a pick.
FARKUS: Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you'll have a very bright future here at ED Granmont.
FARKUS: Yes, Ms. De Granmont? Ms. De Granmont: Who is this pervert little weasel?
FATHER: And this offends you as a Jewish person.
FATHER: I have a discomfort in my molar.
FATHER: I haven't heard that one.
FATHER: Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife.
FATHER: Naw, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob kills someone they through the body in the river.
FATHER: Now if you'll excuse me.
FATHER: One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed.
FATHER: Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives.
FATHER: Tell me your sins, my son.
FATHER: That's a kneeler.
FATHER: That's no sin.
FATHER: Um...
FATHER: We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony.
FATHER: Well.
FD: They're art. You hang them on the wall.
FDR: Alright.
FDR: Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead!
FDR: I have my reasons.
FDR: I like it a lot. Ow!
FDR: Oh!
FDR: That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star and double-wished you to drop dead. Here's your change.
FDR: That's just a silly superstition.
FDR: That's right. My birthday wish was for you to drop dead.
FDR: Then I'm quadruple-wishing!
FEMALE WORKER: Elaine, cake?
FEMALE WORKER: It's carrot. It's good for you. WORKERS: Get well get well soon, we wish you to get--
FEMALE WORKER: It's Walter's special day.
FG: I LUV their chances.
FG: It's a deal!
FG: No hitting? They got hitting! Bonilla, Murry. ...They got no defence.
FG: Speed? They got Coleman. ...They need a bullpen.
FG: They got Franco! ...What they need is a front office.
FG: They still have no pitching. Goodin's a question mahk. ...You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast.
FIREMAN: All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it!
FIREMAN: How do you live with yourself?
FIRST THING: you should wear boxer shorts. KRAMER
FLISHT ATTENDANT: Mr. Seinfeld?
FLORIST: Cop made me disconnect it. George grabs the broom from the florist, and begins beating at the flames with
FLORIST: How would you happen to know that?
FLORIST: You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?
FOREMAN: We find the defendants - guilty.
FOREMAN: We have, Your Honor.
FOWLER: Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.
FOWLER: No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!
FOWLER: Where are the cameras?
FRANK :Can I talk to her, please?
FRANK: 2 o'clock.
FRANK: A woman? What are you out of your mind?
FRANK: Aah!!!
FRANK: Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
FRANK: Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
FRANK: And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
FRANK: And stay away from those squirrels. At JerryÂ’s girlfriendÂ’s apartment.
FRANK: And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
FRANK: Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve. MRS. ROSS: Is it possible they took it back?
FRANK: Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
FRANK: Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
FRANK: Assman? I'll get him, Assman!
FRANK: Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
FRANK: Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
FRANK: Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
FRANK: Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
FRANK: But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
FRANK: Carlo! It's me, Frank! I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
FRANK: Costanza, you're white hot!
FRANK: Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
FRANK: Don't bring me down. Do you have another copy of that photo?
FRANK: Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
FRANK: Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice.
FRANK: Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
FRANK: Eight ball.
FRANK: Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
FRANK: Five dollars a game, huh?
FRANK: Follow through? What do you mean?
FRANK: Gamebird?
FRANK: George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
FRANK: George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
FRANK: George, open the door.
FRANK: George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes.
FRANK: George? This is a surprise. Who's the suit?
FRANK: Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?
FRANK: Get outta here! We have a booth.
FRANK: Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
FRANK: Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
FRANK: Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
FRANK: Have you seen the pole, Kruger?
FRANK: he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
FRANK: He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
FRANK: He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
FRANK: He's gonna see it.
FRANK: Hello, woman.
FRANK: Here, take a look at this.
FRANK: Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet. MR. ROSS: It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!
FRANK: Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt! George Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay?
FRANK: Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the
FRANK: His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
FRANK: Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
FRANK: How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
FRANK: How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
FRANK: How hard could it be to kill this thing?
FRANK: How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
FRANK: How'd you get yours?
FRANK: Huh?
FRANK: I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
FRANK: I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.
FRANK: I can't make anything..
FRANK: I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
FRANK: I didn't read his resume.
FRANK: I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that!
FRANK: I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
FRANK: I don't like this waiter. Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
FRANK: I fell on some Fusilli.
FRANK: I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
FRANK: I got things to do, too.
FRANK: I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
FRANK: I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun!
FRANK: I had an affair with a Korean woman. Elaine: Uh, Mr. Costanza, I
FRANK: I had to make a living!
FRANK: I never seen people treated like this!
FRANK: I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
FRANK: I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
FRANK: I still say we're related.
FRANK: I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
FRANK: I will not tolerate infestation.
FRANK: I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
FRANK: I'd know him anywhere.
FRANK: I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
FRANK: I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
FRANK: I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
FRANK: I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger?
FRANK: I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous.
FRANK: If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
FRANK: In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years
FRANK: It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
FRANK: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. A Festivus for the rest of us!
FRANK: It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
FRANK: It's Carlo. I found him!
FRANK: It's him! It's Carlo Costanza!
FRANK: It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
FRANK: IÂ’m calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
FRANK: Kim?
FRANK: Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
FRANK: Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
FRANK: Let me see it.
FRANK: Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
FRANK: Let's begin. KRUGER: Dr.. Van Nostrand?
FRANK: Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space.
FRANK: Let's rumble!
FRANK: Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!
FRANK: Look at this, George. You ever seen a silver dollar?
FRANK: Manssierre!
FRANK: Manssierre! You...!
FRANK: Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
FRANK: Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say,  eno enoa juang . Which means, this guy - this is not my kind of guy.
FRANK: Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
FRANK: Maybe?
FRANK: My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
FRANK: My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
FRANK: No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.
FRANK: No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
FRANK: No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
FRANK: No! You never said milky white!
FRANK: No, I brought it in. They never put it out. MRS. ROSS: Where is it?
FRANK: No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me. Elaine: Mr. Costanza, I,
FRANK: No, not billiard.. Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
FRANK: No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
FRANK: No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. They don't want me, I don't want them!
FRANK: Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
FRANK: Not really.
FRANK: Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
FRANK: Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
FRANK: Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
FRANK: Oh boy.
FRANK: Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
FRANK: OK that's it! We're moving!
FRANK: Okay, THAT'S IT! oki on awa Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.
FRANK: Okay, where's my boy?
FRANK: Okay.
FRANK: Order a hot dish.
FRANK: Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
FRANK: Read that poem.
FRANK: Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
FRANK: Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! Come here!
FRANK: Serenity now!
FRANK: Serenity nowww!
FRANK: She was.
FRANK: She's not pretty?
FRANK: So let him have bananas on the side!
FRANK: So, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
FRANK: So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
FRANK: So, what am I supposed to say?
FRANK: So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
FRANK: Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
FRANK: Stop crying, and fight your father!
FRANK: Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother-
FRANK: Take a look.
FRANK: Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
FRANK: Thank you.
FRANK: That's not a booth!
FRANK: That's perverse.
FRANK: The Maestro? What Maestro?
FRANK: The man on the tape wasn't specific.
FRANK: The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
FRANK: There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
FRANK: There's a Costanza in Tuscany? Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
FRANK: There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
FRANK: They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
FRANK: They made a derogatory comment about me.
FRANK: They're not coming?
FRANK: This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
FRANK: This is the best Festivus ever!
FRANK: This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
FRANK: Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading,
FRANK: Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
FRANK: Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?
FRANK: We call it.. the, uh..
FRANK: We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
FRANK: We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
FRANK: We had some good times.
FRANK: We still haven't finished the first game.
FRANK: Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
FRANK: Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
FRANK: Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
FRANK: What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
FRANK: What do you know.. Alright. I guess I was wrong.
FRANK: What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
FRANK: What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
FRANK: What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it? MR. ROSS: Yes.
FRANK: What ever happened to Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?!! --
FRANK: What is that, like a little chicken?
FRANK: What is this thing anyway? MRS. ROSS: It's Cornish gamehen.
FRANK: What the hell does that mean?
FRANK: What was that?
FRANK: What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
FRANK: What, they brainwashed you?
FRANK: What?
FRANK: Where's that breeze coming from?
FRANK: Where's your friend Kramer?
FRANK: Who put you up to this, was it her?
FRANK: Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
FRANK: Why do you need all that ketchup for?
FRANK: Why not?
FRANK: Why should they go to waste?!?
FRANK: Why wouldn't they like us? Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
FRANK: Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
FRANK: Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
FRANK: Will you put her to rest for me?
FRANK: Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
FRANK: Would you believe when I was 18, I had a silver dollar collection?
FRANK: Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
FRANK: Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
FRANK: Yeah.
FRANK: Yeah. I'll take some.
FRANK: Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
FRANK: Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
FRANK: You can look for sneakers the next day!
FRANK: You come here.
FRANK: You don't even know what they're made from.
FRANK: You don't know that! We're gonna go see him, huh?
FRANK: You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
FRANK: You got the A, B, C the D. That's the biggest.
FRANK: You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
FRANK: You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.
FRANK: You like to gamble, Cosmo?
FRANK: You never mentioned them to me!
FRANK: You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants?
FRANK: You sayin' you want a piece of me?
FRANK: You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
FRANK: You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
FRANK: You step on it and it flushes.
FRANK: You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.
FRANK: You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse.
FRANK: You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!
FRANK: You wanna piece of me? You got it!
FRANK: You were the one who smothered him.
FRANK: You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner
FRANK: You're not kidding it's a good move!
FRANK: You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel vigorous.
FRANK: Your mother recommended him.
FRANK: YouÂ’re not performing any rituals in this house.
FRANK: YouÂ’ve been in there an hour.
FRED: ...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so
FRED: Anyway, go on.
FRED: Cause they make you nauseous, right?
FRED: Do you wanna have dinner tonight?
FRED: Hey Jerry.
FRED: I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.
FRED: I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it.
FRED: Mmm, no.
FRED: No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys.
FRED: Not ringing a bell.
FRED: Oh yeah, yeah, right.
FRED: Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.
FRED: Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.
FRED: Soo - what happened?!
FRED: Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were
FRED: The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.
FRED: The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's no transportation...
FRED: Um, hello?
FRED: We have?
FRED: What was your name again?
FRED: What, you have other plans?
FRED: Who's Russ Meyer?
FRED: Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted.
FRED: Yeah?
FRED: You're lucky, at least you got something to do. Elaine walks in.
FRENCH FRIES: out, BLT: out!...I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sittin' here with a carrot!
FRIEND: What about that underwater escape?
FURNITURE GUY: I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.
FURNITURE GUY: I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.
G: Hi.
GARDNER: He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us bastards out on the town. I said: that son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store
GARDNER: I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch in the front office. Wilhelm, I think his name.
GAURD: We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond.
GAVIN: Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!
GAVIN: Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.
GAVIN: He won't hurt you, he's just playing.
GAVIN: I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
GAVIN: Jerry?
GAVIN: Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.
GAVIN: My dog. What about my dog? Attendant #1: Uh, you have a dog?
GAVIN: Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?
GAVIN: Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy. Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the cabin where flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.
GAVIN: Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.
GAVIN: Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.
GAVIN: Would you take care of Farfel?
GAVIN: Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top notch physicians.
GAVIN: You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.
GENDERSON: Ah, just drive.
GENDERSON: I told you not to take the turnpike.
GENDERSON: If we took the palisades this never have happened.
GENNICE:
GENNICE: . . . Thank you.
GENNICE: Hi Jerry.
GENNICE: How do you like this?
GENNICE: I gotta go.
GENNICE: I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy. Nobody in the show will even talk to me.
GENNICE: I'm really nervous.
GENNICE: My grandmother died.
GENNICE: Nice to meet you.
GENNICE: No it was really good.
GENNICE: No, please. This is the first time in my life that anyone has ever done anything like this for me. I've always had to struggle so hard for everything I ever got. and I know this is going to be my big break.
GENNICE: No. I'm on the bench today.
GENNICE: Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened.
GENNICE: Oh, it's okay,
GENNICE: Oh, yeah, she'll be here. . . . Oh no, my frankfurter, my frankfurter fell . It was really good. I can't believe that I dropped it.
GENNICE: What?
GEOGE: Nope. Just a, giving a chair to the security guard.
GEOPRGE: What?

GEORGE: 'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
GEORGE: 'Cause it's all in the greeting.
GEORGE: 'Cause it's signals, Jerry , it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?
GEORGE: 'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone! Kramer returns from the bathroom and picks up the phone.
GEORGE: 'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau..
GEORGE: 'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... you know ...bubble. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
GEORGE: 'Hoochie mama'?
GEORGE: 'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are
GEORGE: 'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
GEORGE: 'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
GEORGE: 'Mickey'? 'Mickey'! George walks away, half-laughing at Jerry's ludicrous suggestion.
GEORGE: 'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, but you only gave me change for a ten.
GEORGE: 'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'

GEORGE: . . . Why not?
GEORGE: . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
GEORGE: . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.

GEORGE: Because I uh, I told her the truth.
GEORGE: Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
GEORGE: Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
GEORGE: Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
GEORGE: Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money. Jerry holding up a hamburger while holding George's wallet.

GEORGE: Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
GEORGE: Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!

(Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out
GEORGE: Eh, don't mention it.
GEORGE: Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.

GEORGE: Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff .
GEORGE: Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot. At the office.
GEORGE: Elaine!
GEORGE: Elaine's coming up?
GEORGE: Elaine's moving into your building?
GEORGE: Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
GEORGE: Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
GEORGE: Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
GEORGE: Elaine, get off the speaker!
GEORGE: Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of.
GEORGE: Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
GEORGE: Elaine, Julie.
GEORGE: Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
GEORGE: Elaine, sheÂ’s a psychic. She knows how the kidÂ’s going to be.
GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?
GEORGE: Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
GEORGE: Elaine.

GEORGE: Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. I was going nuts.
GEORGE: Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
GEORGE: Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
GEORGE: Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
GEORGE: Ewing's hurt? How long is he going to be out?

GEORGE: Fire! Get out of the way!
GEORGE: Fire!! The florist is standing holding a broom. George rushes to him.
GEORGE: Fired? Why?
GEORGE: First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
GEORGE: First she screams, George, what are you doing?! My God! And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
GEORGE: First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.

GEORGE: He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
GEORGE: He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.

GEORGE: I am aware. I am aware. At Jerry's apartment.
GEORGE: I am different, yeah. Mr. Cushman: I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.
GEORGE: I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time .
GEORGE: I am king of the county. You?
GEORGE: I am not buying something just to get change.
GEORGE: I am not giving you my code.
GEORGE: I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
GEORGE: I am ready.
GEORGE: I am.
GEORGE: I am. I'm a nice guy.. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair - I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, she's on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn't do that. I would've insulted her.
GEORGE: I am? What a strange coincidence..
GEORGE: I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls , here at the stadium , don't offer much by way of privacy . But I was thinking if we extend the doors
GEORGE: I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday?
GEORGE: I broke 'em playing basketball.
GEORGE: I broke up with her.
GEORGE: I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
GEORGE: I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
GEORGE: I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
GEORGE: I can do this, Jerry.
GEORGE: I can never get the package open in time.
GEORGE: I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
GEORGE: I can't
GEORGE: I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
GEORGE: I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
GEORGE: I can't believe I get paid for this.
GEORGE: I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault.
GEORGE: I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.
GEORGE: I can't believe it, you saw her before me.
GEORGE: I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
GEORGE: I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
GEORGE: I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
GEORGE: I can't believe this!
GEORGE: I can't believe what I'm hearing.
GEORGE: I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
GEORGE: I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
GEORGE: I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
GEORGE: I can't believe: WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
GEORGE: I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call.
GEORGE: I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
GEORGE: I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
GEORGE: I can't concentrate in front of you.
GEORGE: I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy.
GEORGE: I can't do these puzzles.
GEORGE: I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?
GEORGE: I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
GEORGE: I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
GEORGE: I can't find my glasses.
GEORGE: I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
GEORGE: I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
GEORGE: I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
GEORGE: I can't hear you.
GEORGE: I can't read it. I need my glasses!
GEORGE: I can't say.
GEORGE: I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
GEORGE: I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of underwear.
GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?!
GEORGE: I can't talk to Jerry anymore, even since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
GEORGE: I can't tell anymore.
GEORGE: I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
GEORGE: I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
GEORGE: I can't tell you, don't ask.
GEORGE: I can't tell you.
GEORGE: I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
GEORGE: I can't.
GEORGE: I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
GEORGE: I canÂ’t believe how easy it is. IÂ’m virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and IÂ’m in the club.
GEORGE: I canÂ’t. I met them. TheyÂ’re devout. You know, In the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
GEORGE: I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
GEORGE: I cheated in the contest.
GEORGE: I climbed out the window.
GEORGE: I confused it with another awning.
GEORGE: I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
GEORGE: I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
GEORGE: I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be
GEORGE: I could take it in merchandise..
GEORGE: I could..
GEORGE: I couldn't take it anymore.
GEORGE: I did!
GEORGE: I did, I'm trying to call China.

GEORGE: I didn't have any sex.
GEORGE: I didn't have make-up sex.
GEORGE: I didn't know he'd get fired.
GEORGE: I didn't know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, this is incredible.
GEORGE: I didn't know there was a fireplace?
GEORGE: I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
GEORGE: I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
GEORGE: I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. MR. ROSS: What?

GEORGE: I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
GEORGE: I don't have my ATM card.
GEORGE: I don't know but he ain't funny.
GEORGE: I don't know her.
GEORGE: I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
GEORGE: I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
GEORGE: I don't know how you put up with this.
GEORGE: I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
GEORGE: I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for . Newman ; Gentlemen , gentlemen . I am so happy to see you both. There is just
GEORGE: I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right
GEORGE: I don't know what the reason could be.
GEORGE: I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
GEORGE: I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, you see?
GEORGE: I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
GEORGE: I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael to town.
GEORGE: I don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.
GEORGE: I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
GEORGE: I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? I
GEORGE: I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
GEORGE: I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
GEORGE: I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
GEORGE: I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
GEORGE: I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here or go to the coffee shop.
GEORGE: I don't know, what we're doin' here, this is ridiculous.
GEORGE: I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.
GEORGE: I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
GEORGE: I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
GEORGE: I don't know. He said he wants to be my key brother.
GEORGE: I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
GEORGE: I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
GEORGE: I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
GEORGE: I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
GEORGE: I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.
GEORGE: I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
GEORGE: I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
GEORGE: I don't know. That's all gonna change.

GEORGE: I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
GEORGE: I don't like to discuss figures.
GEORGE: I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
GEORGE: I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
GEORGE: I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
GEORGE: I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
GEORGE: I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
GEORGE: I don't think it's gonna work out...
GEORGE: I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
GEORGE: I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.
GEORGE: I don't think we should see each other any more.
GEORGE: I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
GEORGE: I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
GEORGE: I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
GEORGE: I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.

GEORGE: I don't understand why you spend time with this guy.
GEORGE: I don't understand women.
GEORGE: I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?

GEORGE: I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
GEORGE: I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?

GEORGE: I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
GEORGE: I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no hair, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently baldy likes a slimmer guy.

GEORGE: I had a fight with Susan.
GEORGE: I had a job interview.
GEORGE: I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
GEORGE: I had no idea.
GEORGE: I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up, all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy.. This is my cousin.. this is my brother.. thisis my father.
GEORGE: I had to give it to the liquor store guy.

GEORGE: I see what you mean.
GEORGE: I see your G.P.A's a 4.0. STUDENT 3: You like that, don't you?

GEORGE: I show up.
GEORGE: I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
GEORGE: I snapped! It was the last straw.
GEORGE: I solve problems. That's just what I do.
GEORGE: I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get?
GEORGE: I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
GEORGE: I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
GEORGE: I still don't understand how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
GEORGE: I still have brill cream. At JerryÂ’s girlfriendÂ’s apartment.
GEORGE: I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
GEORGE: I still haven't figured him out.
GEORGE: I still paid for it!
GEORGE: I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
GEORGE: I stopped having sex.
GEORGE: I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.

GEORGE: I suppose I could.
GEORGE: I suppose you could be an architect...
GEORGE: I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the office.
GEORGE: I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence?
GEORGE: I tell you everything, right?
GEORGE: I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy you a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
GEORGE: I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
GEORGE: I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a
GEORGE: I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
GEORGE: I think he was impressed.
GEORGE: I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a
GEORGE: I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
GEORGE: I think I had some hard candy in there. George sees the delivery man bringing the massage chair into his apartment.
GEORGE: I think I like the girl better than the voice.
GEORGE: I think I may be in love with this woman.
GEORGE: I think I saw him. I think it's him.
GEORGE: I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?
GEORGE: I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG
GEORGE: I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
GEORGE: I think I'll have a piece of cake.
GEORGE: I think I'm having a heart attack.
GEORGE: I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
GEORGE: I think it's on the wagon.
GEORGE: I think IÂ’m getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
GEORGE: I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
GEORGE: I think she finds my stupidity charming.
GEORGE: I think she likes me.
GEORGE: I think so.
GEORGE: I think somethinÂ’ bit me. I just need another nickel.
GEORGE: I think that you think that a certain something is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it should be, and
GEORGE: I think that's a good sign.
GEORGE: I think that's mine.
GEORGE: I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
GEORGE: I think that's one of mine .
GEORGE: I think that's what the back of closets are for. Elaine looks out the window
GEORGE: I think the hats. The hat convey that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
GEORGE: I think they really went for that Soda.
GEORGE: I think this is him right here.
GEORGE: I think those are my socks!
GEORGE: I think we got a bite on it.
GEORGE: I think we have.
GEORGE: I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
GEORGE: I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
GEORGE: I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
GEORGE: I think.
GEORGE: I think.
GEORGE: I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
GEORGE: I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
GEORGE: I thought I saw something fly over here...
GEORGE: I thought Kramer was watching.
GEORGE: I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
GEORGE: I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef .
GEORGE: I thought we'd all sign the picture. Joe Mayo walking up to the gang with an armload of guests' coats.
GEORGE: I thought you meant the..
GEORGE: I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
GEORGE: I thought you said one o' clock.
GEORGE: I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
GEORGE: I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don't tell you.
GEORGE: I told her I would have to think about it.
GEORGE: I told her that she was pretentious.
GEORGE: I told her the truth.
GEORGE: I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
GEORGE: I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
GEORGE: I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
GEORGE: I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
GEORGE: I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
GEORGE: I told you it looked like her..
GEORGE: I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. You'd get all the money back - you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont.
GEORGE: I told you to stop with the hopping.
GEORGE: I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
GEORGE: I told you.
GEORGE: I told you.
GEORGE: I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
GEORGE: I tried to tell you, but you wouldnÂ’t listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? ThereÂ’s now laws in this place. Anything goes! ItÂ’s Thunderdome!
GEORGE: I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. Susan's so attached to this thing.
GEORGE: I uh got the first name.
GEORGE: I uh, took care of that.
GEORGE: I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
GEORGE: I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
GEORGE: I walked.
GEORGE: I want evens.
GEORGE: I want to know how did that get into my car?
GEORGE: I want you to find out is she likes me.
GEORGE: I want you to have this job. Of course...
GEORGE: I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
GEORGE: I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
GEORGE: I was curious!
GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
GEORGE: I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, where I remained.. She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts
GEORGE: I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
GEORGE: I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.
GEORGE: I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
GEORGE: I was just curious.
GEORGE: I was just in there. It's embarrassing.
GEORGE: I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert. Nina leaves - woman exits stall
GEORGE: I was naked.
GEORGE: I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
GEORGE: I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was trying to kill me. Susan tell him.
GEORGE: I was seven and a half.
GEORGE: I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting those raccoons.
GEORGE: I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
GEORGE: I was telling you about Noel.
GEORGE: I was there! I saw a drain!
GEORGE: I was trying to make a point.
GEORGE: I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
GEORGE: I wasn't talking to you.
GEORGE: I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
GEORGE: I went to the beach.
GEORGE: I will not blow this.
GEORGE: I will, sir. Top priority.
GEORGE: I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
GEORGE: I won't feel like a writer.
GEORGE: I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
GEORGE: I wonder if that's really true.
GEORGE: I wonder why.
GEORGE: I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
GEORGE: I would imagine it's all naked.
GEORGE: I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body.
GEORGE: I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
GEORGE: I wouldn't mind seein' .
GEORGE: I wouldn't think so.
GEORGE: I zipped up!
GEORGE: I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. Here we go, all right.
GEORGE: I'd get tired of it.
GEORGE: I'd kill to be a 32.
GEORGE: I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
GEORGE: I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
GEORGE: I'd like to help, but my neck..
GEORGE: I'd rather go to a hanging.
GEORGE: I'll be right back.
GEORGE: I'll be right here.
GEORGE: I'll call a plumber right now!
GEORGE: I'll fake an illness. My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
GEORGE: I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face!
GEORGE: I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
GEORGE: I'll give you a quarter.
GEORGE: I'll have 'em overnight it.
GEORGE: I'll have the clam casino.
GEORGE: I'll have the tuna.
GEORGE: I'll just, uh, get a paper...
GEORGE: I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story.
GEORGE: I'll meet her outside the building.
GEORGE: I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
GEORGE: I'll see you guys later .
GEORGE: I'll see you.
GEORGE: I'll take it in my room.
GEORGE: I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown.
GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. Hey, is anybody listening?!
GEORGE: I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
GEORGE: I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
GEORGE: I'll try a piece.
GEORGE: I'm a bad man!
GEORGE: I'm a bootlegger.
GEORGE: I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
GEORGE: I'm a man. Jerry:, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
GEORGE: I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
GEORGE: I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wwear them every time I see her.
GEORGE: I'm all set.
GEORGE: I'm an architect.
GEORGE: I'm an architect.
GEORGE: I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
GEORGE: I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
GEORGE: I'm aware of you, all right, let's go , let's go! You're on stage in 25 minutes.
GEORGE: I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.

GEORGE: I'm choking!
GEORGE: I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
GEORGE: I'm emotional.
GEORGE: I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
GEORGE: I'm excited about the pouty.
GEORGE: I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin! George thumps his fists against the door in frustration. He's crying as

GEORGE: I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?

GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...
GEORGE: I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
GEORGE: I'm not sure.
GEORGE: I'm not taking a civil service test.

GEORGE: I'm such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showing how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what
GEORGE: I'm sure he'll be back in a second.

GEORGE: If I was a different person.
GEORGE: If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you
GEORGE: If only something like that could happen to me.

GEORGE: If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
GEORGE: If you donÂ’t say anything I will assume itÂ’s a plane crash.
GEORGE: If you had five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Cluck, puk cluck? Because if they have individual personalities I don't think we should be eating them. What's the matter with you?
GEORGE: If you want.
GEORGE: If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's going to want to hang around Drexler's funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
GEORGE: If you're bleak, you're bleak.
GEORGE: If you're having second thoughts, if you didn't want it,
GEORGE: If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.

GEORGE: Is she socially awkward?
GEORGE: Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
GEORGE: Is that Elaine?
GEORGE: Is that good?
GEORGE: Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
GEORGE: Is that really?
GEORGE: Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza. Lord of the Idiots!
GEORGE: Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a little bit worried that you may have missed the boat?

GEORGE: Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
GEORGE: Is that tolerable?
GEORGE: Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad? Elaine: It's okay, you don't

GEORGE: It better be.
GEORGE: It doesn't help
GEORGE: It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
GEORGE: It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
GEORGE: It happens.
GEORGE: It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
GEORGE: It is too!
GEORGE: It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
GEORGE: It just came to me.
GEORGE: It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.
GEORGE: It just does.
GEORGE: It looks like it hasn't been washed.
GEORGE: It makes me look older.
GEORGE: It means a non-Jewish woman.
GEORGE: It says that on the computer?
GEORGE: It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
GEORGE: It seemed so disorganized.
GEORGE: It seems like a problem.
GEORGE: It stinks.
GEORGE: It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
GEORGE: It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said Yes! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
GEORGE: It varies.
GEORGE: It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
GEORGE: It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
GEORGE: It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
GEORGE: It was Moops.
GEORGE: It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
GEORGE: It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
GEORGE: It was on CNN This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
GEORGE: It was when I was banging! MEMBER 2: All right, if you really are one of us.. let's see you take the wallet off the next guy who walks by.
GEORGE: It was.
GEORGE: It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
GEORGE: It will be my first one.
GEORGE: It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
GEORGE: It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
GEORGE: It'll be different this time.
GEORGE: It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
GEORGE: It'll take to long.
GEORGE: It's a big flat noodle.
GEORGE: It's a big region.
GEORGE: It's a bit hilly - no?
GEORGE: It's a broad noodle.
GEORGE: It's a calzone , sir . Mr. . Steinbrenner: A calzone huh . Pass it down here . Let's have a look at

People be coming up to me, just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . . ELAINE: Oh, wait a minute. There's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. Okay, let me out. You, whatever your name is
GEORGE: It's a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
GEORGE: It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
GEORGE: It's a talent I have.
GEORGE: It's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
GEORGE: It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
GEORGE: It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. Do you know where the arrivals are? The woman walks away. George addresses the man standing on the other side.
GEORGE: It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
GEORGE: It's all politics.
GEORGE: It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
GEORGE: It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
GEORGE: It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'
GEORGE: It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
GEORGE: It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night. I can't remember the last time that happened.
GEORGE: It's an early Christmas present.
GEORGE: It's an expression.
GEORGE: It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
GEORGE: It's bad?
GEORGE: It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
GEORGE: It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
GEORGE: It's called a T-square.
GEORGE: It's coming Jerry, it's coming.
GEORGE: It's complicated.
GEORGE: It's dismissive.
GEORGE: It's effeminate to sit like this?
GEORGE: It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
GEORGE: It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
GEORGE: It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
GEORGE: It's George
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George:.
GEORGE: It's Guys And Dolls, not Guys And Guys.
GEORGE: It's huge!
GEORGE: It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
GEORGE: It's in... transit.
GEORGE: It's Jerry's fault.
GEORGE: It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
GEORGE: It's just that, I know her, and boy...
GEORGE: It's just we want you to go.
GEORGE: It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
GEORGE: It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
GEORGE: It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
GEORGE: It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this: Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
GEORGE: It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
GEORGE: It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.

GEORGE: It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
GEORGE: It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
GEORGE: It's not funny, Elaine.
GEORGE: It's not him!
GEORGE: It's not me! It's the car!
GEORGE: It's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
GEORGE: It's not real. They're all made up.
GEORGE: It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over
GEORGE: It's not that easy. It's like Beat The Clock, there's a lot of pressure there.
GEORGE: It's not that long, really.
GEORGE: It's not the money!
GEORGE: It's not the same.
GEORGE: It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working.
GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it..
GEORGE: It's nothing.
GEORGE: It's OK.
GEORGE: It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
GEORGE: It's only a few blocks.
GEORGE: It's ooh As in ooh ooh ah ah.
GEORGE: It's possible.
GEORGE: It's probably chocolate.
GEORGE: It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
GEORGE: It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
GEORGE: It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so... INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY
GEORGE: It's Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for televising opera.

GEORGE: It's Susan
GEORGE: It's that bleak?
GEORGE: It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy. Back in Tim Whatleys office..Jerry wakes up , his vision blurred. He sees
GEORGE: It's the pesto of cities. So..?
GEORGE: It's the real deal.
GEORGE: It's the same movie! What's the difference?
GEORGE: It's two completely different sounds. ih and eh.
GEORGE: It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
GEORGE: It's working already!
GEORGE: It's your apartment!
GEORGE: It's your decision.
GEORGE: It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
GEORGE: It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh! George stands up.
GEORGE: Italian.
GEORGE: Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
GEORGE: Its not easy. New scene - George and Jerry at the coffee shop.

GEORGE: ItÂ’s wrinkled. ItÂ’s worthless.
GEORGE: IÂ’d like a doggie bag for this please. The End.
GEORGE: IÂ’d like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
GEORGE: IÂ’d love to go. Make an appointment.
GEORGE: IÂ’m a weed in HitlerÂ’s bunker.
GEORGE: IÂ’m fine.
GEORGE: IÂ’m here helpinÂ’ you.
GEORGE: IÂ’m starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
GEORGE: IÂ’m starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
GEORGE: IÂ’ve had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
GEORGE: IÂ’ve had my difficulties.
GEORGE: IÂ’ve spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers of identification of any kind for him to select from.
GEORGE: Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
GEORGE: Jean-Paul?
GEORGE: Jerk off.
GEORGE: Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
GEORGE: Jerry did you wash this pear?
GEORGE: Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
GEORGE: Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
GEORGE: Jerry it's funny , Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
GEORGE: Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, where would we be going? At a Chinese restaurant.
GEORGE: Jerry said he didn't like it.
GEORGE: Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
GEORGE: Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. Jerry.
GEORGE: Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.

GEORGE: Jerry! Stop it!
GEORGE: Jerry! Up here!
GEORGE: Jerry,
GEORGE: Jerry, . . .
GEORGE: Jerry, can I talk to you for a second?
GEORGE: Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
GEORGE: Jerry, did you hear that?
GEORGE: Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, Teach me to sing like you.
GEORGE: Jerry, I gotta talk to you.
GEORGE: Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
GEORGE: Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
GEORGE: Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
GEORGE: Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
GEORGE: Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life. George pushes the machine onto the street. From a view in the sky, we see him dodging cars, hopping back and forth into lanes of traffic. Frogger music and sound effects play.
GEORGE: Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I
GEORGE: Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible
GEORGE: Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set foe the week end. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
GEORGE: Jerry, it's not my fault.
GEORGE: Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it. Outside on the street. Jerry and Elaine walking toward each other.
GEORGE: Jerry, let me tell you something, A man without hand is not a man. I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
GEORGE: Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a
GEORGE: Jerry, look at my eyes.
GEORGE: Jerry, my young friend, you are so nave. You are so so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I am negotiating. Negotiation, this is what you do in business.
GEORGE: Jerry, No!
GEORGE: Jerry, oh my God. He wants to talk about Jerry?
GEORGE: Jerry, simmer down.
GEORGE: Jerry, the Mets lost.
GEORGE: Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.

GEORGE: Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
GEORGE: Jimmy, right.
GEORGE: Joe Mayo's apartment?
GEORGE: Just a little something for Christmas.
GEORGE: Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
GEORGE: Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch..!
GEORGE: Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
GEORGE: Just CALL!
GEORGE: Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She is sexy though. Don't you think?
GEORGE: Just enjoying watching you. Other restaurant

GEORGE: Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
GEORGE: Kramer, I really owe you one.
GEORGE: Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.

GEORGE: Kramer, she's a model.
GEORGE: Kramer, they like everybody. TheyÂ’re friendly people.
GEORGE: Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.

GEORGE: Leslie.
GEORGE: Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
GEORGE: Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
GEORGE: Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
GEORGE: Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
GEORGE: Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
GEORGE: Let me be the architect, I can do it!
GEORGE: Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
GEORGE: Let me just call him.
GEORGE: Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
GEORGE: Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the same!
GEORGE: Let me just see it.
GEORGE: Let me put that on speaker phone.

GEORGE: Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
GEORGE: Let's not forget the radiator, the steam has been on here for ten years; no human can turn this off.
GEORGE: Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
GEORGE: Let's see if it's Hayman?
GEORGE: Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
GEORGE: Lets not stand here, we might run in to her.
GEORGE: Lighten up.
GEORGE: Lights out.

GEORGE: Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
GEORGE: Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
GEORGE: Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
GEORGE: Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. This is guts.
GEORGE: Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
GEORGE: Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a refund. You gave me ladies' frames!
GEORGE: Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
GEORGE: Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take

GEORGE: Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
GEORGE: Lobster.
GEORGE: Loni Anderson?!
GEORGE: Look at me! I am man! I am you! The man in the other car looks over at George. Elaine, sitting behind George, aids in the cause by pleading to the man by mouthing the words, Hi, can we go in?
GEORGE: Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping todays
GEORGE: Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, IÂ’ll walk out of here right now!

GEORGE: Look I need you to do me a favor . I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's .
GEORGE: Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
GEORGE: Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
GEORGE: Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
GEORGE: Look, I guarantee she won't know.
GEORGE: Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
GEORGE: Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.

GEORGE: No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
GEORGE: No I didn't!
GEORGE: No I'm not. I was bald. Elaine grabs at the toupee, George dodges the grab.
GEORGE: No I, I want it if you don't want it!

GEORGE: No! ThereÂ’s no coconut!
GEORGE: NO!!
GEORGE: No!...not...nothing.
GEORGE: No, anything.
GEORGE: No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
GEORGE: No, but I have very good repute with women, very good, top form. And the first time I laid my I on brassieres I was enthralled.
GEORGE: No, can't say as I did.
GEORGE: No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a jerk...
GEORGE: No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
GEORGE: No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial, in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial.
GEORGE: No, her too. And her mother.
GEORGE: No, I brought a picture of the chair.
GEORGE: No, I didn't hear anything.
GEORGE: No, I didn't.
GEORGE: No, I don't care.
GEORGE: No, I don't have any change.
GEORGE: No, I don't have it yet.
GEORGE: No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
GEORGE: No, I don't want it. I want it, if you don't want it.
GEORGE: No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
GEORGE: No, I froze.
GEORGE: No, I got my own place.
GEORGE: No, I know I don't have to, I want to. MRS. ENRIGHT: George, you are such a gentleman.
GEORGE: No, I saw Home Alone II.
GEORGE: No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
GEORGE: No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
GEORGE: No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
GEORGE: No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
GEORGE: No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!
GEORGE: No, I'm saying, if a situation arose in which you didn't want it, I might take it.
GEORGE: No, I, I don't think so.
GEORGE: No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
GEORGE: No, I-I-I know... I know...
GEORGE: No, impossible! It's your apartment.
GEORGE: No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
GEORGE: No, it's not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
GEORGE: No, it's not.
GEORGE: No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married.
GEORGE: No, Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
GEORGE: No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
GEORGE: No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
GEORGE: No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye.
GEORGE: No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
GEORGE: No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?!
GEORGE: No, no she wasn't.
GEORGE: No, no thanks.
GEORGE: No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that in medical journals. It's a freak thing, but...
GEORGE: No, no the full size.
GEORGE: No, no you really look great.
GEORGE: No, no,
GEORGE: No, no,
GEORGE: No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?

GEORGE: No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick it up later.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no.. I'm it. I win.
GEORGE: No, no, no, this suit is not for sale.
GEORGE: No, no, no,no you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
GEORGE: No, no, no. He just left.
GEORGE: No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, what is chicken Kiev, I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
GEORGE: No, no, no... Just a tiny bit... It's not even frontal nudity. It's... sidal nudity...
GEORGE: No, no, pff...
GEORGE: No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment. George sits down in the chair.
GEORGE: No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
GEORGE: No, no, we'll talk about it later.
GEORGE: No, no, what, what?
GEORGE: No, no. Deena, it's not what you think. Deena turns and begins to walk away.
GEORGE: No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
GEORGE: No, no. He's just being modest.
GEORGE: No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
GEORGE: No, no. I reached down and there was nothing there. Kramer enters.
GEORGE: No, no. I'm just thinking.
GEORGE: No, no. I'm not going on.
GEORGE: No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
GEORGE: No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
GEORGE: No, no....
GEORGE: No, no...I hate the condom.
GEORGE: No, not a loser!
GEORGE: No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
GEORGE: No, not at all...
GEORGE: No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
GEORGE: No, not really.
GEORGE: No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really! TARTABULL: Alright, alright.
GEORGE: No, not that I know of.
GEORGE: No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.

GEORGE: No, that's it.
GEORGE: No, that's Jerry.
GEORGE: No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg .
GEORGE: No, that's not it at all.
GEORGE: No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .

GEORGE: No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
GEORGE: No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You'reyou're a separatee.
GEORGE: No, you're not out there.
GEORGE: No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
GEORGE: No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You cannot abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.

GEORGE: No. I didn't get it.
GEORGE: No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello? Kramer peels and eats an orange.
GEORGE: No. I wouldnÂ’t even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
GEORGE: No. I--I paid for it.
GEORGE: No. It didn't take.
GEORGE: No. Just imagine her reaction.
GEORGE: No. No T-bone.
GEORGE: No. No way.

GEORGE: No...
GEORGE: No...
GEORGE: No... Jerry; So...
GEORGE: No... What guy?

GEORGE: See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
GEORGE: See, It's not so hard.
GEORGE: See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks
GEORGE: See?
GEORGE: See? This looks right to you, doesn't it? Mr. Thomassoulo: Uh, yeah, I guess.
GEORGE: Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear.

GEORGE: She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
GEORGE: She doesn't want to get a bra.
GEORGE: She doesn't.
GEORGE: She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her performances.

GEORGE: She says we canÂ’t go out anymore.
GEORGE: She stole twenty dollars from me. Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
GEORGE: She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't like nice.
GEORGE: She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it. Jerry; You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're
GEORGE: She told me to Go to hell! and I took the bus home.
GEORGE: She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.

GEORGE: That won't be necessary.
GEORGE: That's a good score.
GEORGE: That's a great idea!!!
GEORGE: That's a little steep don't you think ?
GEORGE: That's a myth. George takes a bite of his sandwich and gets a piece stuck to his chin.
GEORGE: That's a sandwich.
GEORGE: That's a shame.
GEORGE: That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.

GEORGE: That's my vow to you.
GEORGE: That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
GEORGE: That's nerve...
GEORGE: That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book?
GEORGE: That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
GEORGE: That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
GEORGE: That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk.

GEORGE: That's right. You ready?
GEORGE: That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
GEORGE: That's so brutal, I hate that.
GEORGE: That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
GEORGE: That's the one your parents bought you?
GEORGE: That's true, that always happens to me.
GEORGE: That's true.
GEORGE: That's unbelievable!
GEORGE: That's unbelievable.
GEORGE: That's very dirty. That's absolutely filthy.
GEORGE: That's what I wanna know.

GEORGE: The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
GEORGE: The outlet?
GEORGE: The panties your mother laid out for you? What does that mean?

GEORGE: The plane's been re-routed back to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
GEORGE: The prop comic? Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut? RONNIE: Nostrils.

GEORGE: The security guard.
GEORGE: The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!

GEORGE: The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.
GEORGE: The whole hour just flew by.
GEORGE: The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
GEORGE: The woman she's lesbianing with? Susan told me she's never been with a guy.
GEORGE: Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself.
GEORGE: Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!
GEORGE: Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
GEORGE: Then I got off the phone right away.
GEORGE: Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
GEORGE: Then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today. But if you look

GEORGE: Then, I'm at The Foundation...
GEORGE: There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's .

GEORGE: They're breaking up? How do you know?
GEORGE: They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
GEORGE: They're making their decision today.
GEORGE: They're MY books.
GEORGE: They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. One big nude-a-rama.
GEORGE: They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
GEORGE: They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
GEORGE: They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
GEORGE: They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
GEORGE: They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
GEORGE: TheyÂ’re the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
GEORGE: Things are good. After a pause, George starts whistling, then picks a chew toy off the floor and squeezes it towards Elaine, making a squeaking sound.
GEORGE: Think I'M not?

GEORGE: We had a deal!
GEORGE: We hardly read anything!
GEORGE: We just came from Chadway's What's going on.
GEORGE: We ordered the wedding invitations today, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this
GEORGE: We really should be, uh, heading out..
GEORGE: We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
GEORGE: We should have left earlier. I told you.
GEORGE: We should take his limo.
GEORGE: We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you. Doctor leaves , George returns to the others
GEORGE: We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there's this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
GEORGE: We'll come up with something.
GEORGE: We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.

GEORGE: We're in Turkey?
GEORGE: We're not dead.
GEORGE: We're not stealing it.
GEORGE: We're out of Bosco!
GEORGE: We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal exactly 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking out of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup.
GEORGE: We're really glad for ya.
GEORGE: We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
GEORGE: We're straightening out!

GEORGE: Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
GEORGE: Well do you want me to take it off ?
GEORGE: Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
GEORGE: Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
GEORGE: Well George,. . . .

Actually she broke up with me and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
GEORGE: Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
GEORGE: Well how do you even know itÂ’s hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?

GEORGE: Well I spoke to Elaine...
GEORGE: Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week .... Um shouldn't you be at work by now ?
GEORGE: Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want to tag along with you or anything.
GEORGE: Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, do you mind if I watch it here?
GEORGE: Well I would eat you.
GEORGE: Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!! Jerry; Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
GEORGE: Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
GEORGE: Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
GEORGE: Well I've done that.
GEORGE: Well I-I...
GEORGE: Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
GEORGE: Well if she can't tell six from sex then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
GEORGE: Well it was a helluva yada yada.
GEORGE: Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
GEORGE: Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?

GEORGE: Well seems it's about time for George's lunch.
GEORGE: Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
GEORGE: Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
GEORGE: Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
GEORGE: Well that makes sense.
GEORGE: Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
GEORGE: Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know
GEORGE: Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
GEORGE: Well they're hard to load.
GEORGE: Well this is bad . I am really in a bad situation now .
GEORGE: Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
GEORGE: Well today's your lucky day.

GEORGE: Well where is she?
GEORGE: Well who doesn't.
GEORGE: Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
GEORGE: Well why didn't we?
GEORGE: Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like .
GEORGE: Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile. Camera is on George. Denise takes off her hat. The camera is still on George. His expression changes to surprise.
GEORGE: Well why'd she do that?
GEORGE: Well you didn't have to say it like that.
GEORGE: Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
GEORGE: Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
GEORGE: Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
GEORGE: Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
GEORGE: Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
GEORGE: Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
GEORGE: Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very...crafty.
GEORGE: Well, aren't you something?
GEORGE: Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry about the set.
GEORGE: Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
GEORGE: Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
GEORGE: Well, did you see it?
GEORGE: Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
GEORGE: Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
GEORGE: Well, giddy-up!
GEORGE: Well, go ahead! Do it!
GEORGE: Well, he does.
GEORGE: Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
GEORGE: Well, here we are.
GEORGE: Well, here you go. What do you think?

GEORGE: Well, how good a look did you get?
GEORGE: Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here.
GEORGE: Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
GEORGE: Well, I am not going.
GEORGE: Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
GEORGE: Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
GEORGE: Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just gonna be wishing there were walkways. What are you doing?
GEORGE: Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
GEORGE: Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
GEORGE: Well, I didn't really tell Susan: about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
GEORGE: Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
GEORGE: Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
GEORGE: Well, I do what I can.
GEORGE: Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
GEORGE: Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
GEORGE: Well, I got another Audrey Hepburn movie.
GEORGE: Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
GEORGE: Well, I got my triangles.
GEORGE: Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left.
GEORGE: Well, I gotta do somethin'.
GEORGE: Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
GEORGE: Well, I guess these would be out of the question.
GEORGE: Well, I have to see her.
GEORGE: Well, I heard a noise.
GEORGE: Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
GEORGE: Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
GEORGE: Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
GEORGE: Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
GEORGE: Well, I might be getting in to that.
GEORGE: Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
GEORGE: Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
GEORGE: Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti?
GEORGE: Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse me, I would like to get started please.
GEORGE: Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
GEORGE: Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod. I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres.
GEORGE: Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
GEORGE: Well, I was wondering...
GEORGE: Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift.
GEORGE: Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
GEORGE: Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
GEORGE: Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done a solid before.
GEORGE: Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
GEORGE: Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
GEORGE: Well, I'm mentioning his name.
GEORGE: Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly
GEORGE: Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
GEORGE: Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
GEORGE: Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
GEORGE: Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be
GEORGE: Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
GEORGE: Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
GEORGE: Well, I've rented another video, Joe. And there's some popcorn. I thought we could do it again.
GEORGE: Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
GEORGE: Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
GEORGE: Well, I-I just recently uh...
GEORGE: Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
GEORGE: Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention
GEORGE: Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
GEORGE: Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
GEORGE: Well, is he good, Kramer? George gets up and walks towards Kramer.
GEORGE: Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
GEORGE: Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a caller man. You know how I always make
GEORGE: Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
GEORGE: Well, it happened again.
GEORGE: Well, it was a hell of a ride.
GEORGE: Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
GEORGE: Well, it's . . . much too low.
GEORGE: Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
GEORGE: Well, it's definetly him.
GEORGE: Well, it's getting dark. They leave.
GEORGE: Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to! George leaves, slamming the door behind him.
GEORGE: Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
GEORGE: Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove.
GEORGE: Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
GEORGE: Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
GEORGE: Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
GEORGE: Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
GEORGE: Well, let's just leave.
GEORGE: Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. So uh, you two shop at the same store?
GEORGE: Well, live and learn.
GEORGE: Well, look at this. This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
GEORGE: Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
GEORGE: Well, maybe not married, but...
GEORGE: Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
GEORGE: Well, me neither.
GEORGE: Well, my mother, Jerry..
GEORGE: Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned. KRAMER: Look at you.
GEORGE: Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. By the
GEORGE: Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
GEORGE: Well, okay.
GEORGE: Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
GEORGE: Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why donÂ’t we test your bladder system at my office?
GEORGE: Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
GEORGE: Well, scintillating as always.
GEORGE: Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
GEORGE: Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
GEORGE: Well, she probably just assumed.
GEORGE: Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
GEORGE: Well, so much for purification week.
GEORGE: Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter. George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. Ken and
GEORGE: Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
GEORGE: Well, Steven, I, uh..
GEORGE: Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
GEORGE: Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
GEORGE: Well, that doesn't mean anything!
GEORGE: Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
GEORGE: Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
GEORGE: Well, that was bound to happen!
GEORGE: Well, that's flattering.
GEORGE: Well, that's not offensive. It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
GEORGE: Well, that's really not fair.
GEORGE: Well, that's the name!
GEORGE: Well, that's.. Elaine!
GEORGE: Well, there could be.
GEORGE: Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
GEORGE: Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
GEORGE: Well, they got any golf courses up there?
GEORGE: Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would
GEORGE: Well, they're obviously not here.
GEORGE: Well, this I take to the grave.
GEORGE: Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
GEORGE: Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that. SUSAN: Why not?
GEORGE: Well, uh, are there any other options?
GEORGE: Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.
GEORGE: Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
GEORGE: Well, was it for Costanza or...
GEORGE: Well, we really should be-
GEORGE: Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
GEORGE: Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
GEORGE: Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle. At Jerry's apartment.
GEORGE: Well, we'll just see.
GEORGE: Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
GEORGE: Well, we.. we, we, ah..
GEORGE: Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.
GEORGE: Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?
GEORGE: Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
GEORGE: Well, what are you gonna do?
GEORGE: Well, what do they look like?
GEORGE: Well, what is it?
GEORGE: Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
GEORGE: Well, what should I do, Kramer?
GEORGE: Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
GEORGE: Well, what's the reason?
GEORGE: Well, why don't you go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
GEORGE: Well, yeah.
GEORGE: Well, you can't hear him through the window, but he is definitely shouting
GEORGE: Well, you could move in with my parents.
GEORGE: Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is: You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
GEORGE: Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
GEORGE: Well, you just tell him an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
GEORGE: Well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
GEORGE: Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
GEORGE: Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
GEORGE: Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
GEORGE: Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
GEORGE: Well, you know. It's understandable. He pats Deena on the knee.
GEORGE: Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
GEORGE: Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
GEORGE: Well, you should always consider podiatry. There's nothing wrong with the feet.
GEORGE: Well, You're not gonna believe it...
GEORGE: Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.
GEORGE: Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire.
GEORGE: Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.
GEORGE: Well...I've got a lot to do!
GEORGE: Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... I can hold my own!
GEORGE: Well...not out. She's in prison.
GEORGE: Well...Susan.
GEORGE: Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization.

GEORGE: Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
GEORGE: Yeah, coy.
GEORGE: yeah, Definite smoke.
GEORGE: Yeah, dentist of the stars.
GEORGE: Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? I better take this. I hate the little room. Oh, hello, Doctor.
GEORGE: Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.
GEORGE: Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
GEORGE: Yeah, duty. Do you know how much duty is?
GEORGE: Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
GEORGE: Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work. The door opens and Kramer enters, followed by Newman. Kramer is
GEORGE: Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
GEORGE: Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
GEORGE: Yeah, good, good.
GEORGE: Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
GEORGE: Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah, he did.
GEORGE: Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
GEORGE: Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
GEORGE: Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet show.
GEORGE: Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
GEORGE: Yeah, he's right.
GEORGE: Yeah, here you go.
GEORGE: Yeah, him.
GEORGE: Yeah, how did you know that?
GEORGE: Yeah, I better grab some too.
GEORGE: Yeah, I didn't mean that. Mr. Thomassoulo: Of course you will have your own private, fully equipped
GEORGE: Yeah, I grabbed it on my way, I don't want my mother reading it.
GEORGE: Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
GEORGE: Yeah, I know what happened.
GEORGE: Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell you one thing.. I don't know what he's got. But for a sick guy, he's very strong.
GEORGE: Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
GEORGE: Yeah, I saw it.
GEORGE: Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
GEORGE: Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
GEORGE: Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
GEORGE: Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm
GEORGE: Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
GEORGE: Yeah, I wish.
GEORGE: Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'll zip in, How do you do?, zip out. She'll love me.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm gonna go get a paper.
GEORGE: Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
GEORGE: Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
GEORGE: Yeah, it's George.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's her uncle's.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
GEORGE: Yeah, it's the last one.
GEORGE: Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
GEORGE: Yeah, just like I do.
GEORGE: Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
GEORGE: yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
GEORGE: Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
GEORGE: Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks.
GEORGE: Yeah, like that.
GEORGE: Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
GEORGE: Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
GEORGE: Yeah, me too...
GEORGE: Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need something. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during
GEORGE: Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
GEORGE: Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what going on with her. Don't let any one kid you, it's tough.
GEORGE: Yeah, no pop-in, no in the neighborhood, no I saw your light was on. And the best part is, if things go really well...
GEORGE: Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a
GEORGE: Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
GEORGE: Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great: she was laughing, I was funny. I
GEORGE: Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
GEORGE: Yeah, phew.

GEORGE: Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
GEORGE: Yeah, so? At the office.
GEORGE: Yeah, Sure, sure , I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
GEORGE: Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
GEORGE: Yeah, sure.
GEORGE: Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides, you think I wanna miss this?
GEORGE: Yeah, Susan said you'd be excited.
GEORGE: Yeah, take it easy. (Donna leaves car. George realizes what he has done and bashes his
GEORGE: Yeah, tell'm, but quickly, I'm double parked here.
GEORGE: Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
GEORGE: Yeah, that was enough.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's right.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's right. It's working.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
GEORGE: Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy. LENA: Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m.
GEORGE: Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
GEORGE: Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back
GEORGE: yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
GEORGE: Yeah, uh, no menus.
GEORGE: Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
GEORGE: Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
GEORGE: Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
GEORGE: Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
GEORGE: Yeah, well, they're my socks!
GEORGE: Yeah, well....
GEORGE: Yeah, well...a little ruff finding something good in your price-range. [looks like he remembers something and turns
GEORGE: Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
GEORGE: Yeah, what the hell.
GEORGE: Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
GEORGE: Yeah, why? Why?
GEORGE: Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.
GEORGE: Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we do that again?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta do it classy
GEORGE: Yeah, you gottaÂ’ watch for the jellyfish.
GEORGE: Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...

GEORGE: Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
GEORGE: Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and
GEORGE: Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.
GEORGE: Yeah. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
GEORGE: Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
GEORGE: Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
GEORGE: Yeah. Did you do it?
GEORGE: Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
GEORGE: Yeah. EXT. J PETERMAN BUILDING - DAY - ESTABLISHING

GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.

GEORGE: Yeah. Let's go. Elaine and George, united, head for the door. AS they get there, Elaine
GEORGE: Yeah. MR. ROSS: Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --
GEORGE: Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. Something. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All
GEORGE: Yeah. No problem.
GEORGE: Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted ... and a cup of tea.
GEORGE: Yeah. Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined.
GEORGE: Yeah. Really.

GEORGE: Yeah. We should do this again.
GEORGE: Yeah. Well aparently word's out. Kramer enters.

GEORGE: Yes Mr. Hayman.

GEORGE: Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
GEORGE: Yes sir!
GEORGE: Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.

GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
GEORGE: Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
GEORGE: Yes! How're we gonna do that?
GEORGE: Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
GEORGE: Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.
GEORGE: Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
GEORGE: Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
GEORGE: Yes, as I see it.
GEORGE: Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
GEORGE: Yes, but I am not taking it.
GEORGE: Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
GEORGE: Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
GEORGE: Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.

GEORGE: Yes, I mentioned your name.
GEORGE: Yes, I saw that.
GEORGE: Yes, I think I would.
GEORGE: Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!

GEORGE: Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
GEORGE: Yes, sir.
GEORGE: Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.

GEORGE: Yes, the surprise-blindfold-greeting. That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.
GEORGE: Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
GEORGE: Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
GEORGE: Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
GEORGE: Yes, well, you know, IÂ’m not thinking about the price. You know youÂ’re the only woman IÂ’ve never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I
GEORGE: Yes, yes I am.
GEORGE: Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
GEORGE: Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
GEORGE: Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so...
GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
GEORGE: Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
GEORGE: Yes, yes,.

GEORGE: Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
GEORGE: Yes.
GEORGE: Yes.
GEORGE: Yes.
GEORGE: Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion.
GEORGE: Yes. Changes.
GEORGE: Yes. Father-priest 2: Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly
GEORGE: Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
GEORGE: Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. Excuse me.
GEORGE: Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.

GEORGE: Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
GEORGE: Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember Susan: ? The one that used to work for NBC?
GEORGE: Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No r which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. Hebert it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. All right. I got it.

GEORGE: You do it for me.
GEORGE: You do know Kramer?
GEORGE: You do.
GEORGE: You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.
GEORGE: You don't care for Soda?!

GEORGE: You have to drink that whole thing?
GEORGE: You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
GEORGE: You haven't even seen one.
GEORGE: You hear the way he talks to me?
GEORGE: You heard him.
GEORGE: You heard it fifty times already.
GEORGE: You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?
GEORGE: You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
GEORGE: You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
GEORGE: You just kick her out.
GEORGE: You know , you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
GEORGE: You know a lost and found could be a good idea .
GEORGE: You know a matron?
GEORGE: You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
GEORGE: You know her name?
GEORGE: You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
GEORGE: You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental.
GEORGE: You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
GEORGE: You know I uh, spilled a yohgurt smoothie in here two days ago. Can't smell anything, can y'a?
GEORGE: You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me. flashback
GEORGE: You know maybe ... I'll ...
GEORGE: You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
GEORGE: You know my last name is Costanza . That's Italian . So you and I are like country men . Pisano's !
GEORGE: You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It was worth a hell of a lot more than that cheap Chardonnay.
GEORGE: You know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
GEORGE: You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
GEORGE: You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
GEORGE: You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together.
GEORGE: You know we're living in a society! Jerry walks up from the ramp.
GEORGE: You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is
GEORGE: You know what would be great? If he could see me with some of my black friends.
GEORGE: You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
GEORGE: You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
GEORGE: You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing
GEORGE: You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. I'll just browse around.
GEORGE: You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
GEORGE: You know what? I could probably do this. WhatÂ’s the difference.
GEORGE: You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
GEORGE: You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
GEORGE: You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call.
GEORGE: You know what? Maybe I should take off.
GEORGE: You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
GEORGE: You know, .. blah ...
GEORGE: You know, a muffin can be very filling.
GEORGE: You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
GEORGE: You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
GEORGE: You know, Elaine.
GEORGE: You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. We need you. You're hitting everything.
GEORGE: You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
GEORGE: You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
GEORGE: You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
GEORGE: You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
GEORGE: You know, I got this little swelling right here. It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
GEORGE: You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he
GEORGE: You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
GEORGE: You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is just torture.
GEORGE: You know, I'd go from nods to nothing..
GEORGE: You know, I'm a little nervous.
GEORGE: You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
GEORGE: You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? I just don't see how it could occur.
GEORGE: You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
GEORGE: You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
GEORGE: You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
GEORGE: You know, it's a miracle you're not married. Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
GEORGE: You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!
GEORGE: You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to get a cup of coffee...
GEORGE: You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
GEORGE: you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
GEORGE: You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
GEORGE: You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
GEORGE: You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
GEORGE: You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff.
GEORGE: You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really
GEORGE: You know, Remy, I was thinking. Last time we were together, you...
GEORGE: You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. I'm really hungry.
GEORGE: You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
GEORGE: You know, the guy from Cheers.
GEORGE: You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
GEORGE: You know, the time..
GEORGE: You know, the uh...
GEORGE: You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it. Jerry and Elaine start to walk from the counter towards the table.
GEORGE: You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
GEORGE: You know, we absolutely should.
GEORGE: You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
GEORGE: You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
GEORGE: You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party... We see a flashback of George at seven, sitting in front of a birthday cake with a shocked expression on his face, while Frank and Estelle scream at him:
GEORGE: You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen
GEORGE: You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. . You know it's like pfffff , all right that's enough, you're through.
GEORGE: You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
GEORGE: You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
GEORGE: You know. I was alone..
GEORGE: You know. You use the, uh...
GEORGE: You like ice?
GEORGE: You like that?
GEORGE: You mean alias.
GEORGE: You mean in the end?
GEORGE: You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
GEORGE: You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
GEORGE: You mean one of those vinyl things?
GEORGE: You mean she just laid there topless?
GEORGE: You mean, like, a former member?
GEORGE: You mean, uh..?
GEORGE: You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
GEORGE: You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
GEORGE: You miss her, don't you?
GEORGE: You miss her.
GEORGE: You nervous?
GEORGE: You never had sex in the office before?
GEORGE: You never run out, do you? Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
GEORGE: You never should have taken away his keys!
GEORGE: You only think that because you know me.
GEORGE: You paid that crook?!
GEORGE: You pick it.
GEORGE: You put a hot tub... in your living room?
GEORGE: You ran?
GEORGE: You really think this looks OK on me?
GEORGE: You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
GEORGE: You remember the, the little bank book, there?
GEORGE: You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss! ELAINE: Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
GEORGE: You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
GEORGE: You saw Jane topless?
GEORGE: You saw who, what?
GEORGE: You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
GEORGE: You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
GEORGE: You see that woman on the horse? Ruthie Cohen is passing by on horseback.
GEORGE: You see this is the thing. . . . I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together,
GEORGE: You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
GEORGE: You see, ho ho,
GEORGE: You see, It's right here. It's all white...
GEORGE: You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
GEORGE: You see.....WHAT!!
GEORGE: You see? We were made for each other. It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and
GEORGE: You see?.. You see?!
GEORGE: You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?
GEORGE: You sell them?
GEORGE: You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
GEORGE: You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
GEORGE: You should have lied.
GEORGE: You should take the test for me.
GEORGE: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
GEORGE: You slept with the groom?!
GEORGE: You spritz a little Lysol on it.
GEORGE: You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
GEORGE: You stole the bread?
GEORGE: You sure?
GEORGE: You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
GEORGE: You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
GEORGE: You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. Russell?
GEORGE: You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine is better than Pepsi.
GEORGE: You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
GEORGE: You think I'm going down?
GEORGE: You think it's something?
GEORGE: You think Kramer'll do it?
GEORGE: You think Morgan thinks I have a racial bias?
GEORGE: You think she should have said something?
GEORGE: You think she would care about the red dot?
GEORGE: You think she's happy?
GEORGE: You think so?
GEORGE: You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
GEORGE: You think you could?
GEORGE: You think you're going to the other side with Hi? You're not going to make it. Elaine in the car service car.
GEORGE: You think?
GEORGE: You thought she was good looking, right?
GEORGE: You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell me? I need a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. Gimme a
GEORGE: You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
GEORGE: You took me to one of your shows..
GEORGE: You uh owe me for the ticket.
GEORGE: You wanna sell computers? I will show you how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why
GEORGE: You want me to come back? Uh...
GEORGE: You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
GEORGE: You want to start?
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, El Presidente?
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
GEORGE: You went home with him?
GEORGE: You were supposed to deliver my calzones . We had a deal !
GEORGE: You weren't thinking.
GEORGE: You what?
GEORGE: You what?!
GEORGE: You won the choose.
GEORGE: You won't regret this, sir.
GEORGE: You won't think I'm a bad person?
GEORGE: You would think that, but either you're born with a sense of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
GEORGE: You wouldnÂ’t believe it. Rasputin.
GEORGE: You yearn.
GEORGE: You! Dog man!
GEORGE: You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
GEORGE: You'll do it?
GEORGE: You'll see I'm right.
GEORGE: You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!
GEORGE: You're Batman.
GEORGE: You're blown?
GEORGE: You're calling her?
GEORGE: You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
GEORGE: You're damn right it's me.
GEORGE: You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
GEORGE: You're fresh You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
GEORGE: You're giving me the it's not you, it's me routine? I invented it's not you, it's me. Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
GEORGE: You're going back to New York now?
GEORGE: You're going that way anyway! Stand Up
GEORGE: You're gonna be neighbors.
GEORGE: You're gonna overdry it.
GEORGE: You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
GEORGE: You're gonna tell me...or not.
GEORGE: You're incredible.
GEORGE: You're kidding.
GEORGE: You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
GEORGE: You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
GEORGE: You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
GEORGE: You're not going to get back here in time!
GEORGE: You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
GEORGE: You're not out there! You can't be, because I am out there. And if I see you out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to
GEORGE: You're not really gonna go to California, are you? KRAMER: Up here, I'm already gone.
GEORGE: You're out?
GEORGE: You're out?!
GEORGE: You're parents saw me on TV?
GEORGE: You're right, how did I miss that? Maybe because it's a crock of sht.
GEORGE: You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score! George gets up and leaves in a huff.
GEORGE: You're selling computers?
GEORGE: You're selling the car!?
GEORGE: You're sleepin' with the maid?
GEORGE: You're so uptight.
GEORGE: You're sorry?!
GEORGE: You're spending the weekend with Ellen?
GEORGE: You're supposed to do that?
GEORGE: You're telling me.
GEORGE: You're telling me. So, what do you think?
GEORGE: You're throwing the set?
GEORGE: You're uh, physical therapist, right?
GEORGE: You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. You really had me going there for a minute.
GEORGE: You're with a woman!
GEORGE: You've been demoted. Kramer; Why?
GEORGE: You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
GEORGE: You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
GEORGE: You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
GEORGE: You've never seen this before?
GEORGE: You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
GEORGE: You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
GEORGE: You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?
GEORGE: You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
GEORGE: You-you sure you never slept with her? Perfect.
GEORGE: Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
GEORGE: Your buttocks are spectacular.
GEORGE: Your clothes smell just like Pisano's . There's another Italian place on Jerome . Maybe I can fool him .
GEORGE: Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry? KRAMER: He's sleeping with his maid!
GEORGE: Your hair?
GEORGE: Your hose! Where's your hose?!
GEORGE: Your parents are going to Paris right?
GEORGE: Your wake up guy asked you out?
GEORGE: YouÂ’re not getting no DrakeÂ’s Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, IÂ’m all set. I got the ticket. IÂ’m going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
GEORGE: Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
GEORGE: Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
GEORGE: Zing.
GEORGE: {George, finger in the peanut butter jar}: This is what I do. Doubleday
GEORGE:. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
GEORGE:... It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.
GEORGE:...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
GEORGE:: Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
GEORGE:Ah Ha.
GEORGE:Ahhhhh...
GEORGE:Any money in it?
GEORGE:I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?

GINA: Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
GINA: Come on.
GINA: Come, you walk me to a cab.
GINA: Forget it. Come on.
GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like DrakeÂ’s Coffee Cake.
GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How itÂ’s too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
GINA: Hi.
GINA: How are you?
GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a manÂ’s hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
GINA: I havenÂ’t had one of those since I was a little girl.
GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
GINA: I wasnÂ’t.
GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth . Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
GINA: ItÂ’s Gina.
GINA: MartineÂ’s girl friend.
GINA: No, go ahead.
GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?

GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
GINA: You next door neighbour.
GINA: You will show me The Stooges?
GINA: YouÂ’re still afraid. You are not a man.
GINO: Apologize?
GINO: Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He staring at the hair. knock knock knock
GINO: Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.
GINO: Don't Jerry.
GINO: He knows. He knows about us.
GINO: He make me cry too. You want something to drink?
GINO: He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.
GINO: Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.
GINO: I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.
GINO: I don't think uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
GINO: I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.
GINO: It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up. The Barber of Seville music is playing.
GINO: Just a second. Yes.
GINO: No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
GINO: Nothing. It's just hair.
GINO: Sure, I fix it. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair. So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the

GLENDA: I thought you quit.
GLENDA: What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.
GLENDA: What are you doing here?
GLENDA: What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.
GLENN: Hey, go tell hell!
GOERGE: He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he's got some new thing - you know, there's supposed to be a big merger. He wasn't even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
GOERGE: Oh, c'mon, Jerry. I can't believe this.
GOERGE: Shhhhh. If you want to get in - there's very little time. Sweetheart.. No, no, no. That' ought to coever it. Just a second.. Just a.. let me.. (looks at the check, then take some money out
GOERGE: So ... uh, squirrel.
GOERGE: Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..
GOERGE: What about your stuff?
GOERGE: You know, you have to know how to do that. You can't have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven.
GREG: By the way, you look really great in that leotard.
GREG: Can I have a sip of your water?
GREG: Do you have to be somewhere?
GREG: Haven't seen you in a while.
GREG: Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.
GREG: Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night.
GREG: I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives?
GREG: Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out.
GREG: Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?
GREG: Oh. Well, it was good seeing you.
GREG: See that guy right there? I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too.
GREG: Thanks. ELAINE:
GREG: Then what are you doing?
GREG: Very.
GREG: Wait, ten-thirty. Sorry.
GREG: Well, I gotta take off.
GREG: Why?
GREG: Would ya?
GREG: Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.
GREG: Yeah. Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here.
GREG: You ran the Mini-Marathon?
GROSSBARD: Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30...
GROUP: Yeah!
GSUSAN: That's uh, $18.50.
GUARD: All right, let's go... George checks out the cover shot which shows a picture of the aforementioned prisoner with the caption ``Caught!'' written below.

GUARD: At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.
GUARD: Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.
GUARD: Go ahead. Jean-Paul: Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
GUARD: Hey, hold it! Jean-Paul: I'm late, man, I'm in the race!
GUARD: I don't know.
GUARD: I don't need a chair.
GUARD: I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.
GUARD: I'll get that.
GUARD: Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle?
GUARD: Mr. Ross says this is OK?
GUARD: No.
GUARD: Nope.
GUARD: Not bad. Not bad at all.
GUARD: Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.
GUARD: Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this. Swarm! Swarm!
GUARD: Well who wouldn't?
GUARD: What?
GUARD: Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here. George lifts the last copy from the rack before the con can get it.
GUARD: You're under arrest.

GWEN: Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?
GWEN: Jerry.. hi.
GWEN: Kramer told me.
GWEN: Kramer, Hi!
GWEN: No I didn't. I said sweep. Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up.
GWEN: So, you ready to go?
GWEN: That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.
GWEN: What? You're crazy.
GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.
GWEN: Yeah.
GWEN: Yes sweep.
GWEN: You know, you might want to take the tunnel.
GWEN: You were expecting someone else?
GX: So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.
HAARWOOD: Certainly. Kramer leaves. Haarwood begins to rummage through the contents of the box. After
HAARWOOD: I'm a little ticklish.
HAARWOOD: Mmm, yes, yes. Kramer places the cardboard box marked 'Lost and Found' on the counter.
HAARWOOD: Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.
HAARWOOD: Oh yes, of course you can.
HAARWOOD: Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe.
HAARWOOD: They're half-glasses. Kramer pops his head up, a thought having occurred.
HAARWOOD: Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute. Kramer notices a particular costume.
HAARWOOD: Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.
HAARWOOD: Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could
HAARWOOD: Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?
HAARWOOD: Yes, it was in the lost and found.
HAARWOOD: Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory.
HAARWOOD: Yes, yes, it is.
HAIRDRESSER: So, what do you want to do?
HAIRDRESSER: The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine,
HAL:
HAL: And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed?
HAL: But this isn't still going on.
HAL: Claming?
HAL: Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended.
HAL: Great for the back. Right.
HAL: Hey, Kramer.
HAL: I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.
HAL: I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.
HAL: I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.
HAL: I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients.
HAL: It's just more cheese.
HAL: Kitzmiller.
HAL: Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?
HAL: Not this one. It's called the Lumbar Yard.
HAL: Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back.
HAL: So are you liking the mattress? ELAINE: I am totally loving it. Uh, you know
HAL: So you do like the mattress?
HAL: That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?
HAL: They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?
HAL: What is that smell?
HAL: You and Elaine are pretty close.
HAROLD: Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. Because it's true! Why shouldn't I tell him?
HAROLD: Hello, Jerry.
HAROLD: Hi, Jerry.
HAROLD: I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! I want a big sponge! You can't pick up anything with these! There's no absorption!
HAROLD: I'm not going up. It stinks up there.
HAROLD: I'm not going.
HAROLD: I'm not the one who said eleven o' clock. He makes up his own rules.
HAROLD: Manny, look, Kramer put mousse in his hair.
HAROLD: Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have a wig on. It was horrifying.
HAROLD: No, I'm not going up there.
HAROLD: Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me.
HAROLD: Oh, Jerry.
HAROLD: Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her.
HAROLD: Okay.. your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry.
HAROLD: Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month. Okay.. Okay.
HAROLD: Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. What's the difference? It's true.
HAROLD: What's the matter with you?! I'm talking. So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?
HAROLD: Yeah, yeah.. Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? I was only joking. He thinks I'm going to give you Mrs. Hudwalker's things. We have to go up there now and clean the apartment.
HEALTH INSPECTOR: All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie.
HEALTH INSPECTOR: Are you Poppie?
HEALTH INSPECTOR: Board of health, we've had several complaints.
HEALTH INSPECTOR: I think you'd better come with me.
HEATHER: Alright George I'll be honest, the first time we went out, I found you very irritating, but after seeing you for a couple of times, you
HEATHER: Be my guest.
HEATHER: Can I help you?
HEATHER: Hello?
HEATHER: Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean, maybe the maid took it, I had people over, but...

HELEN: And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
HELEN: And they liked your idea?
HELEN: And this other one's the one?
HELEN: And when's the funeral?
HELEN: Are you okay?
HELEN: Are you sure?
HELEN: At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave.
HELEN: Because you made such a big fuss about it.
HELEN: Blanche.
HELEN: Blanche?
HELEN: Bum bum bum bum...
HELEN: Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...

HELEN: Doesn't like you? How can that be?
HELEN: Doesn't that watch look like the one we gave Jerry.
HELEN: Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.
HELEN: Don't go.
HELEN: Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
HELEN: Don't worry, he's comfortable.
HELEN: Elaine, I really--
HELEN: Elaine...
HELEN: Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
HELEN: For fun?
HELEN: George must be happy about that.
HELEN: Goodbye, Jerry.
HELEN: He calls every week. Are you all right?
HELEN: He didn't think you'd accpet.
HELEN: He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
HELEN: He likes looking.
HELEN: He loves that pen.
HELEN: He says he's fine.
HELEN: He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
HELEN: He used to go with her...
HELEN: He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened? Morty shrugs, the phone rings, Morty answers.
HELEN: He won't last a day in prison.
HELEN: He's after you?
HELEN: He's an idealist.
HELEN: He's joking.
HELEN: He's kidding, Manya.
HELEN: He's what?!
HELEN: Hello Aaron
HELEN: Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. Sure, sure, we'll see you then. The funeral's Wednesday.
HELEN: Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. You're giving him back that pen.
HELEN: Hello?.. Hello?
HELEN: Hi Elaine.
HELEN: Hi Jerry......What's wrong?
HELEN: Hi.
HELEN: How can anyone not like him.
HELEN: How could you still see her if your not interested?
HELEN: How did you know that?
HELEN: How much is a rent-a-car?
HELEN: Howbout A milk glass.
HELEN: Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
HELEN: I can do that.
HELEN: I can see if there was a weight problem...
HELEN: I don't even know how to work it.
HELEN: I don't have a dress to wear. And you. You don't have anything.
HELEN: I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
HELEN: I don't know.
HELEN: I don't think so.
HELEN: I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet.
HELEN: I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
HELEN: I hate her like poison.
HELEN: I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight.
HELEN: I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
HELEN: I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
HELEN: I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now.
HELEN: I know what it was...
HELEN: I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson...
HELEN: I thought you were getting it.
HELEN: I told you it was good.
HELEN: I told you to let us sleep in there.
HELEN: I told you...
HELEN: I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
HELEN: I was very comfortable.
HELEN: I wouldn't be any trouble?
HELEN: I'll ask him when he gets up.
HELEN: I'll get it!
HELEN: I'll make a few phone calls.
HELEN: I'm bringing it for Jerry.
HELEN: I'm next.
HELEN: I'm not playing with you anymore...
HELEN: I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
HELEN: Idiot... So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren?
HELEN: If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
HELEN: Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
HELEN: Is that what she said?
HELEN: It looks ridiculous.
HELEN: It was a crime of passion.
HELEN: It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
HELEN: It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
HELEN: It's from scuba diving.
HELEN: It's from the Sachs Fifth Avenue in Miami.
HELEN: It's in the constitution.
HELEN: It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
HELEN: It's raining.
HELEN: Jack, what are you doing?
HELEN: Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
HELEN: Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
HELEN: Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
HELEN: Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
HELEN: Jerry's glasses?
HELEN: Jerry, do your act.
HELEN: Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
HELEN: Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
HELEN: Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
HELEN: Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
HELEN: Jerry, she's fantastic.
HELEN: Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?
HELEN: Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
HELEN: Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
HELEN: Jery, no one's forcing you.
HELEN: Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
HELEN: Just what I said, here.
HELEN: Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
HELEN: Kramer?
HELEN: Leo says he's the best there is.
HELEN: Leo, where did you get that watch?
HELEN: Macadamian nuts?
HELEN: Maybe
HELEN: Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
HELEN: Morty, did you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
HELEN: Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
HELEN: Morty, what are you doing?
HELEN: Morty, will you stop it!
HELEN: Morty, you're talking too loud.
HELEN: Morty.
HELEN: Morty.
HELEN: Nana!!!
HELEN: No, I donÂ’t think that.
HELEN: No, it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
HELEN: No, no, no, that won't do. He may have a Z...
HELEN: No, we'll stay in there.
HELEN: No, we're taking a cab.
HELEN: No, why should we take over your apartment?
HELEN: No.
HELEN: No.
HELEN: No. I'm fine.
HELEN: Nobody pays for everyting.
HELEN: Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
HELEN: Oh I had a coke.
HELEN: Oh I think that's them!
HELEN: Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.
HELEN: Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
HELEN: Oh thanks again. AARON & HELEN: Buh bye.
HELEN: Oh you have to go you have to
HELEN: Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.

HELEN: Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
HELEN: Ok, let me get my coat.
HELEN: Ok.
HELEN: Or maybe a juice glass.
HELEN: Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.
HELEN: Quo? Is that a word?
HELEN: Really, you could do that?
HELEN: Say it. JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN: Astronaut!
HELEN: Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
HELEN: See you downstairs with the car.
HELEN: She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..
HELEN: She knows what?
HELEN: She's not six-six.
HELEN: She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
HELEN: Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
HELEN: Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?
HELEN: Since always. We've never liked them.
HELEN: Since when is George a writer?
HELEN: So bring her.
HELEN: So don't go.
HELEN: So stay home.
HELEN: So we have you for five more days!
HELEN: So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
HELEN: So why did you say anything?
HELEN: So you've got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
HELEN: So, did you hear Claire's getting married?
HELEN: So, how come nothing materialized there?
HELEN: So, what was it?
HELEN: So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.
HELEN: Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
HELEN: STELLA! STELLA!
HELEN: That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
HELEN: That's exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
HELEN: That's it. I'm going to send you fifty dollars.
HELEN: That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
HELEN: The lake is real.
HELEN: The least you could have done was hear your diagnosis.
HELEN: They were supposed to be here at 7:30. Call the airlines again.
HELEN: They'll be here at two o'clock... Oh, Elaine called. She said she'd be here at 2:30. Oh, and she says ``Hope your meeting went
HELEN: They're all gonna leave.
HELEN: They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
HELEN: They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes...
HELEN: This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
HELEN: This is your greatest moment? A game?
HELEN: This one is kind of scratched.
HELEN: Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel.
HELEN: Tonight?
HELEN: Two o' clock, Wednesday. What?
HELEN: Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, we have plans.
HELEN: Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
HELEN: Up to her office?
HELEN: Wait, I just want to see something...
HELEN: We adore Elaine.
HELEN: We can't take money.
HELEN: We don't even sleep.
HELEN: We don't use it.
HELEN: We got it at Sullivan's. It's a good store.
HELEN: We have no plans.
HELEN: We have plans.
HELEN: We have plans.
HELEN: We just came down for a funeral.
HELEN: We'll call you.
HELEN: We'll pay for the car.

HELEN: Well the doctor must be busy.
HELEN: Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
HELEN: Well you must have done something.
HELEN: Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
HELEN: Well, I think she's a very attractive girl.
HELEN: Well, it's not the sofa.
HELEN: Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
HELEN: Well, what am I gonna do it in?
HELEN: Well. You could have taken it with you.
HELEN: Were you waiting long at the gate?
HELEN: What about you?
HELEN: What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
HELEN: What did Blanche say?
HELEN: What did you take his pen for?
HELEN: What do you have to go scuba diving for?
HELEN: What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
HELEN: What does that mean?
HELEN: What guy?
HELEN: What happened to you? KRAMER: Well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
HELEN: What happened to your eyes?
HELEN: What happened?
HELEN: What happened?
HELEN: What kind of problems?
HELEN: What was that about?
HELEN: What's going on?
HELEN: What's he like?
HELEN: What's the matter?
HELEN: What's wrong with our car?
HELEN: What?
HELEN: What?
HELEN: What? He's not even working.
HELEN: What? Nothing.
HELEN: What? You're crazy.
HELEN: Whatever I wrote down.
HELEN: When would we go?
HELEN: Where are you going with those?
HELEN: Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
HELEN: Where do you get Loni Anderson?
HELEN: Where's that watch we bought you?
HELEN: Which one is she?
HELEN: Who am I, Rich Little?
HELEN: Who did you talk to?
HELEN: Who is she? When did this happen? MORTY: I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
HELEN: Why are you doing this?
HELEN: Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
HELEN: Why did you make me put that down?
HELEN: Why is he after you?
HELEN: Why not?
HELEN: Why would they? Nobody bought them then.
HELEN: Why, you thinking of moving?
HELEN: Why?
HELEN: Why?
HELEN: Will you challenge it?
HELEN: Will you stop?
HELEN: With the instructor?
HELEN: Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this...
HELEN: Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
HELEN: Yes.
HELEN: You came all the way from Florida to see him.
HELEN: You could have used our car.
HELEN: You didn't have to take it.
HELEN: You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
HELEN: You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
HELEN: You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? What's wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear - this!
HELEN: You have to
HELEN: You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
HELEN: You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect.
HELEN: You know, you should give Manya a call.
HELEN: You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do?
HELEN: You want me to get that?
HELEN: You want my urine?
HELEN: You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.
HELEN: You're crazy.
HELEN: You're going underwater?
HELEN: You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
HELEN: You're hot?
HELEN: You're hurting my eardrum. MERYL: Well, you must have done something with it!
HELEN: You're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
HELEN: You're not wearing that to a funeral.
HELEN: You're such a stickler...
HELEN: Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
HELEN: Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?
HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?
HEYMAN: Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja
HEYMAN: Can't Stand Ya'.
HEYMAN: Can't stand ya, Can't stand ya.
HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.

HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
HOLLY: . . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .
HOLLY: A little.
HOLLY: Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?
HOLLY: Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.
HOLLY: Everybody like mutton?
HOLLY: Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?
HOLLY: I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before.
HOLLY: I decided I was going to make you dinner.
HOLLY: I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,
HOLLY: It's Holly.
HOLLY: Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.
HOLLY: Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions.
HOLLY: So, is the chop the way you like it?
HOLLY: That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
HOLLY: That was in Grandma's study.
HOLLY: Then who did?
HOLLY: They're grandma Memma's.
HOLLY: Was it mutton?
HOLLY: Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.
HOLLY: What about the napkins?
HOLLY: When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.
HOLLY: Where are the napkins?
HOLLY: Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.
HOLLY: You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!
HOLLY: You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.
HOLLY: Your butcher, down the street.
HOMELESS MAN: Hey that's my coffee! At the police station

HOYT: And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
HOYT: And then what happened?
HOYT: And then you left the bakery.
HOYT: And what was your connection to the defendants?
HOYT: And what's your connection to the defendant?
HOYT: And what's your occupation?
HOYT: And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
HOYT: Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
HOYT: But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?
HOYT: Call Donald Sanger to the stand.
HOYT: Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
HOYT: Call Mabel Choate to the stand.
HOYT: Call Sidra Holland to the stand.
HOYT: Call Yev Kassem to the stand.
HOYT: Cock fighting?
HOYT: Contest?
HOYT: Could you spell that?
HOYT: Did one of them have a video camera?
HOYT: Excuse me?
HOYT: How did she try to kill you?
HOYT: How do you know the defendants?
HOYT: How long was his book overdue?
HOYT: I call Marla Penny to the stand.
HOYT: It's alright. Take your time.
HOYT: It's okay.
HOYT: Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.
HOYT: Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
HOYT: No further questions.
HOYT: Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th.
HOYT: So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp.
HOYT: So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992.
HOYT: So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
HOYT: So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?
HOYT: So they just stood there and did nothing?
HOYT: So they were just standing there?
HOYT: So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
HOYT: So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
HOYT: So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was?
HOYT: So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?
HOYT: So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?
HOYT: So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?
HOYT: State your name.
HOYT: The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
HOYT: Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.
HOYT: Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!
HOYT: We are, Your Honor.
HOYT: We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.
HOYT: What did he want?
HOYT: What do you call them?
HOYT: What does a library cop do?
HOYT: What was that?
HOYT: What was the nature of the contest?
HOYT: Why would she do something like that?
HOYT: Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
HOYT: Yes?
HOYT: You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?
HOYT: Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.
HOYT: Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.
HOYT: Your marble rye?
HUSBAND: Leave me alone.
I MEAN: I'm Donna Chang. JERRY
IAN:  What are doing?
IAN: ..Cheery-o

JACKIE: 20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
JACKIE: A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
JACKIE: And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
JACKIE: Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
JACKIE: Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
JACKIE: Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
JACKIE: Free coffee?

JACKIE: Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
JACKIE: Hm Hm. You take a sip?
JACKIE: How much?
JACKIE: I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own damn coffee. I wanted to hear what came after that Plus.
JACKIE: I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
JACKIE: I said out.
JACKIE: I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
JACKIE: I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
JACKIE: I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
JACKIE: It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
JACKIE: Jackie.
JACKIE: Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
JACKIE: My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
JACKIE: No money? Then what'd we get?
JACKIE: No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
JACKIE: No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
JACKIE: Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
JACKIE: Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
JACKIE: Oh no.
JACKIE: Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
JACKIE: OK You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
JACKIE: Pull over here driver this is it.
JACKIE: Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
JACKIE: So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
JACKIE: So. Then what happened?
JACKIE: Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
JACKIE: Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. We're gonna run some test on that top.
JACKIE: The who?
JACKIE: The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
JACKIE: This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
JACKIE: Was there a top on it?
JACKIE: We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days.
JACKIE: Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your
JACKIE: Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
JACKIE: You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
JACKIE: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the
JACKIE: Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
JACKIE: Your face is my case.
JAKE: Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
JAKE: Goodnight! Elaine is forced to leave. We cut to Jerry's apartment. He's having a poker night.

JAKE: I got a few messages, I wrote them down.
JAKE: I would like to be alone now, please.
JAKE: I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
JAKE: If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
JAKE: Lets see, they are...here they are.
JAKE: No thanks.

JAKE: So?
JAKE: Tell me.
JAKE: Then when did you get those?
JAKE: Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
JAKE: Well, you can put one on this one: I'm leaving!
JAKE: Well, you notice anything?
JAKE: What are you talking about?

JANET: You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus.

JERRY: And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me
JERRY: And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
JERRY: And if you do?
JERRY: And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you. George snaps his fingers and points to Jerry, signaling his agreement. Then he
JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
JERRY: And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
JERRY: And it's probably a union thing.
JERRY: And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
JERRY: And milk.
JERRY: And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?
JERRY: And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
JERRY: And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
JERRY: And she said Yes?
JERRY: And shopping.
JERRY: And that guy is your new boss?
JERRY: And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
JERRY: And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
JERRY: And the guy never knows?
JERRY: And the indigent.
JERRY: And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!
JERRY: And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
JERRY: And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
JERRY: And then there's Maude.
JERRY: And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...
JERRY: And there's so much more to go.
JERRY: And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
JERRY: And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
JERRY: And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
JERRY: And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
JERRY: And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
JERRY: And what's gonna happen?
JERRY: And what's with people getting sick?
JERRY: And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
JERRY: And what, hope for a crash?
JERRY: And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
JERRY: And where does it end? Then, everyoneÂ’s doinÂ’ it. ItÂ’s like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, DonÂ’t go there. - SomeoneÂ’s gotta take a stand!
JERRY: And where were you?
JERRY: And who makes the switch?
JERRY: And who were you tryinÂ’ to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
JERRY: And yet he continues to live.
JERRY: And you are?
JERRY: And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in
JERRY: And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
JERRY: And you didn't even hear how she sounded.
JERRY: And you don't...
JERRY: And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
JERRY: And you waved it away. WOMAN 2: Right.
JERRY: And you were integral.
JERRY: And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
JERRY: And you're sure the floss was the catalyst?
JERRY: And you're the model for this perfume?
JERRY: And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you
JERRY: And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
JERRY: And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
JERRY: And?
JERRY: Another Bobka?
JERRY: Another Caf Latte?
JERRY: Another friend?
JERRY: Another one?
JERRY: Another shot, I want another shot.
JERRY: Answering machine. Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
JERRY: Any messages?
JERRY: Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
JERRY: Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
JERRY: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
JERRY: Anything else?
JERRY: Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
JERRY: Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata? Elaine: You don't respect my work at all, do you?
JERRY: Anything's possible...
JERRY: Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
JERRY: Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
JERRY: Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
JERRY: Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need an awkward pause.
JERRY: Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding. Leapin' Larry: Water under the bridge. Come on, I never did get a chance to
JERRY: Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. You know, it's their annual terrorist luncheon. I'm gonna do it is Farsi.
JERRY: Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
JERRY: Anywhere in the city?
JERRY: Anywhere.
JERRY: Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after
JERRY: Ar-moire.
JERRY: Are these seats unbelievable or what?
JERRY: Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
JERRY: Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
JERRY: Are we about throw here Newman ?
JERRY: Are we finished?
JERRY: Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
JERRY: Are you all right?
JERRY: Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a priest to get rid of this thing!
JERRY: Are you insane? Give 'em to me. Kramer: No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage. George: Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter. Kramer: Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
JERRY: Are you kidding?
JERRY: Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
JERRY: Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
JERRY: Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
JERRY: Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
JERRY: Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye.
JERRY: Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
JERRY: Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest. Kramer is in a school bus. He honks his horn. Camera shot down on the bus.
JERRY: Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
JERRY: Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.
JERRY: Are you OK in here?
JERRY: Are you okay? Did he bite you?
JERRY: Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
JERRY: Are you saying...
JERRY: Are you sensing anything right now?
JERRY: Are you serious?
JERRY: Are you sure he canÂ’t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
JERRY: Are you sure you can't stay longer?
JERRY: Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know Those two idiots did something to it.
JERRY: Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
JERRY: Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye.
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you that desperate?
JERRY: Are you?
JERRY: Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
JERRY: Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
JERRY: Aren't you going to take the check down?
JERRY: Art Corr...
JERRY: Artsy?
JERRY: As a guy I don't know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? There's nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that's the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See,
JERRY: As good as it gets.
JERRY: As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
JERRY: As we all do.
JERRY: As you see it?
JERRY: Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
JERRY: Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
JERRY: Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
JERRY: Assman!
JERRY: Assman?
JERRY: At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
JERRY: At me?
JERRY: At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
JERRY: Atomic Sub? Why are you eating there?
JERRY: Au revoir, Le George.
JERRY: Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
JERRY: Audrey.
JERRY: Audrey?
JERRY: Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
JERRY: Aw right.
JERRY: Aw!
JERRY: Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
JERRY: Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
JERRY: Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
JERRY: Aw, that's kind of sweet. George: Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
JERRY: Aw, these are really strong glasses. He takes a step and almost trips over the counter.
JERRY: Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to
JERRY: Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
JERRY: Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
JERRY: Awright, let's see. How about Mug? Mug Costanza, that's original. Or uh, Ketchup?
JERRY: Awright.
JERRY: Aye, aye. Frankie: Oh, there's a spot. Just back up. Large-vehicle reverse beeping starts
JERRY: Aye...... Kramer comes in and yells
JERRY: B.L.?
JERRY: Babu, may I say something?
JERRY: Babu, you're Pakistani?
JERRY: Babu? Babu... Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
JERRY: Back on? What was it doing off?
JERRY: Back to my place. That's right. EXT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY - ESTABLISHING
JERRY: Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?! New scene. Kramer is breaking up with his girlfriend.
JERRY: Bad peach?
JERRY: Bad rap?
JERRY: Bad situation.
JERRY: Bad.
JERRY: Bad? ..Very bad?
JERRY: Bagels?
JERRY: Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
JERRY: Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
JERRY: Bathroom, bathroom is right over there. Barry goes to bathroom
JERRY: Bazooka Joe.
JERRY: Be careful Kramer.
JERRY: Be careful. Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
JERRY: Be right back.
JERRY: Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
JERRY: Beats me. Leapin' Larry: Where the hell's the fire department? I'm gonna lose the whole
JERRY: Beautiful!
JERRY: Beautiful.
JERRY: Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
JERRY: Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
JERRY: Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
JERRY: Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me
JERRY: Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
JERRY: Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
JERRY: Because I gave it to you.
JERRY: Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
JERRY: Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
JERRY: Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
JERRY: Because I know who has it.
JERRY: Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
JERRY: Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
JERRY: Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
JERRY: Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected . He has found a dating loop hole .
JERRY: Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing
JERRY: Because it's a little mint. It's a Junior Mint.
JERRY: Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid... As Jerry slowly comes out of his doze he is about to cross the street as a car comes to him at high speed.
JERRY: Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
JERRY: Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.
JERRY: Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
JERRY: Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
JERRY: Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine!
JERRY: Because she's my wife! And I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying my wife. Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - my wife this, my wife that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
JERRY: Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
JERRY: Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
JERRY: Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name in it, called me up, and we met!
JERRY: Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
JERRY: Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
JERRY: Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
JERRY: Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
JERRY: Because you know we used to go out.
JERRY: Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
JERRY: Because you threw it out.
JERRY: Because you were too busy stealing a book.
JERRY: Because you're a woman!
JERRY: Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
JERRY: Because, HE'S my directions.
JERRY: Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
JERRY: Because...I spent my money on the Clapgo D. 29, it's the most impenetrable lock on the market today...it has only
JERRY: Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise. George: Don't you see? I'm back in.
JERRY: Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
JERRY: Below the equator?
JERRY: Bender.
JERRY: Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
JERRY: Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
JERRY: Best friend? I've never been to your apartment.
JERRY: Beth and Arnie broke up.
JERRY: Between Poland and Morgan?
JERRY: Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
JERRY: Big head That's almost a compliment.
JERRY: Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
JERRY: Birds?
JERRY: Bit you?!
JERRY: Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
JERRY: Bless you.
JERRY: Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
JERRY: Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to? Seth+Jerry: Alright, alright.
JERRY: Bob Cobb.
JERRY: Bomb threat.
JERRY: Bon voyage, Lainey! Elaine is robbed of her peek into the first class section by a drawn curtain and she goes to her seat. However, someone comes after her and:
JERRY: Bonkers? JerryÂ’s girlfriend: My cat. HeÂ’s got this weird sort of skin condition.
JERRY: Booze is not a religion.
JERRY: Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress. There's a ringing from the Schwinn's bell, and Kramer rides it into
JERRY: Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
JERRY: Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
JERRY: Boy sheÂ’s sexy isnÂ’t she?
JERRY: Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna
JERRY: Boy, am I glad to see you.
JERRY: Boy, do you smell something?
JERRY: Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. So, when do you move into the apartment?
JERRY: Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
JERRY: Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me. New scene. Elaine and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with a jacket.
JERRY: Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid. Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
JERRY: Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
JERRY: Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
JERRY: Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
JERRY: Boy, I'm surprised. I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
JERRY: Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
JERRY: Boy, itÂ’s a good thing we came.
JERRY: Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth. George enters and strolls over to the booth. GEORGE: So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio. ELAINE: Ohio? GEORGE: Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
JERRY: Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
JERRY: Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
JERRY: Boy, they really do sound comfortable. GEORGE: Hey, where ya goin'?
JERRY: Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
JERRY: Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
JERRY: Boy, those capes are really coming back.
JERRY: Boy, you are really hungry. George: Hey!
JERRY: Boy, you can really talk some trash. I guess that's better than eating it.
JERRY: Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
JERRY: Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen Girlie Brown would be very proud of you. Enter George
JERRY: Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
JERRY: Boy.
JERRY: Boy..
JERRY: Boy.. I don't know.
JERRY: Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
JERRY: Boys, boys.
JERRY: Brave new world, alright. Kramer, entering Monk's: Hey, you guys.
JERRY: Bridget!
JERRY: Broke even.
JERRY: Broke even. Cut to Regis and Kathy Lee
JERRY: Buddy?
JERRY: Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
JERRY: But - KRAMER: AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.
JERRY: But an 85?
JERRY: But are you still master of your domain?
JERRY: But he was squinting.
JERRY: But he's an old man, Elaine.
JERRY: But I changed my mind..
JERRY: But I could do that and the music.
JERRY: But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
JERRY: But I have to admit, I like flying. I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there. The worst way of flying, I think is standby, you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they call it standby-- you stand there going ``Bye!'' So I was on this flight where the flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't have a uniform for her yet, and that really... makes a big difference,
JERRY: But I need the home bed advantage!
JERRY: But I never walk you home .
JERRY: But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
JERRY: But I thought things were going great.
JERRY: But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
JERRY: But I was promised this slot.
JERRY: But I went ot the funeral.
JERRY: But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people. Frankie: So, can we go for a ride?
JERRY: But I'm not a disturbance!
JERRY: But I'm so good.
JERRY: But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
JERRY: But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
JERRY: But it was in the cylinder!
JERRY: But it's a big complex.
JERRY: But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed.. I'm sure he's got super humor.
JERRY: But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
JERRY: But it's your bodega.
JERRY: But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
JERRY: But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
JERRY: But see look at the collar, see it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash is brings him one step closer, that's what makes
JERRY: But someone is waiting for me!
JERRY: But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
JERRY: But that's not what she thinks.
JERRY: But that's you.
JERRY: But that's your routine.
JERRY: But thatÂ’s what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. TheyÂ’re knee- deep in fungus. This guy know fungus.
JERRY: But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
JERRY: But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
JERRY: But the whole car smells.
JERRY: But then anyone can just look in and see you.
JERRY: But then I found out about the skin cancer.
JERRY: But then we would have missed the whole thing.
JERRY: But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
JERRY: But there's no t in your name. What about G-bone?
JERRY: But they not you arenÂ’t handicapped, arenÂ’t you ashamed?
JERRY: But they're talking about nothing.
JERRY: But this is what you've always wanted. George: It is. I'm just not ready yet.
JERRY: But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
JERRY: But wait a minute...
JERRY: But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
JERRY: But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
JERRY: But what about the messages?
JERRY: But why?
JERRY: But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
JERRY: But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
JERRY: But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
JERRY: But you didn't really do any work.
JERRY: But you don't smoke.
JERRY: But you gotta know how to work the projector.
JERRY: But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right for that machine.
JERRY: But you know me!
JERRY: But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.. ELAINE: No, I'll be seeing you. Good morning, good morning.. Have you ever gotten up in the morning
JERRY: But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
JERRY: But you made it through the day before.
JERRY: But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
JERRY: But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
JERRY: But you took a nap in it.
JERRY: But you were supposed to get me a refund .
JERRY: But you yada yada'd over the best part.
JERRY: But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
JERRY: But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
JERRY: But your were an executive, this is fast food.
JERRY: But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
JERRY: But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
JERRY: But, I don't want to be a pirate!
JERRY: But, when did I do that?
JERRY: But, you know, what if, you know?
JERRY: But...
JERRY: But....
JERRY: But?
JERRY: By Elaine Benes?
JERRY: By Mennen
JERRY: By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
JERRY: By the way, did you see this?
JERRY: By yourself?
JERRY: Bye
JERRY: Bye bye
JERRY: Bye bye
JERRY: Bye shmoopy.
JERRY: Bye thanks. George: Bye, thanks. I can't believe she took the money.
JERRY: Bye!
JERRY: Bye, Dad. Take it easy.
JERRY: Bye.
JERRY: Bye.
JERRY: Bye. Elaine leaves the car and walks away. Jerry restarts the car, when he
JERRY: c'mon ,c'mon....
JERRY: C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...
JERRY: C'mon up.
JERRY: C'mon up.
JERRY: C'mon up. You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
JERRY: C'mon!
JERRY: C'mon! One whiff!
JERRY: C'mon, c'mon, go ahead, move up.
JERRY: c'mon, c'mon....
JERRY: C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
JERRY: C'mon, move up.
JERRY: C'mon, seriously...
JERRY: C'mon, that's not fair!
JERRY: C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
JERRY: C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
JERRY: C'mon.
JERRY: C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.
JERRY: C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
JERRY: C'mon. Just sit down!
JERRY: ca.
JERRY: Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
JERRY: Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
JERRY: Call Rachel.
JERRY: Camp.
JERRY: Can I have a piece of that?
JERRY: Can I have my keys...

JERRY: Chicken?
JERRY: China really?

Alright, weÂ’re back together again, great. Bye bye. (Scene: Hallway Â– Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank.

JERRY: Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
JERRY: Coach to India - The only way to go.
JERRY: Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee.
JERRY: Coffee?
JERRY: Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment.

JERRY: Come on up. Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
JERRY: Come on! George: is getting married! Elaine: Is he happy? Scene At the restaurant! George: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be. George: I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor? Susan: Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there. George: Isn't that why we have locks on the doors? Susan: Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken. George: A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system. Susan: Can we change the subject, please? George: Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject? Susan: No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it. George: It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum. Susan: Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum. George: How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests. Scene
JERRY: Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!

JERRY: Depends.
JERRY: Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!
JERRY: Dermatology?
JERRY: Did he call you last night?
JERRY: Did I get a head start?
JERRY: Did I just see that?!
JERRY: Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?

JERRY: Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
JERRY: DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
JERRY: Didn't you see the sign on the door?
JERRY: Discount?
JERRY: Disgusting?
JERRY: Do I have to ask?
JERRY: Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
JERRY: Do I have to?
JERRY: Do I know you?
JERRY: Do I really have to explain why?
JERRY: Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question. Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. He comes back groggy.

JERRY: Doctor? HeÂ’s a podiatrist.
JERRY: Does it ever bother you that this organization-
JERRY: Does it smell like the East River?
JERRY: Does she hate cigarettes?
JERRY: Does she know?
JERRY: Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
JERRY: Does what?
JERRY: Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
JERRY: Doesn't matter. What's the young man's name? I would like to meet him.
JERRY: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
JERRY: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
JERRY: Doesn't think anyone can tell?
JERRY: Dollars?
JERRY: Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
JERRY: Don't ask me!
JERRY: Don't ask.
JERRY: Don't be alarmed.
JERRY: Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
JERRY: Don't blow this.
JERRY: Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples.
JERRY: Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
JERRY: Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
JERRY: Don't get up, please, allow me. Jerry picks up the paper
JERRY: Don't get up.
JERRY: Don't go a-knockin'. Estelle, after George opens the van door: Oh, my god! George, seeing his parents being intimate: Oh, my god! Frankie: Now you gotta sell this van.

JERRY: Don't say that.
JERRY: Don't spell.
JERRY: Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway. k What happened there?
JERRY: Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
JERRY: Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. There's your food.
JERRY: Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
JERRY: Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
JERRY: Don't worry.. Kramer! Kramer!.. It's Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!..
JERRY: Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to
JERRY: Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
JERRY: Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
JERRY: Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling.
JERRY: Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
JERRY: Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
JERRY: Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
JERRY: Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
JERRY: Don't you think she could tell?
JERRY: Don't you think she would've heard I was there?
JERRY: Done what?
JERRY: Done.
JERRY: Donna, really, you're making too much of this. K One hundred percent Cotton Dockers, if they're not Dockers, they're just
JERRY: Doofus? Elaine: Yo.
JERRY: Double good-bye!
JERRY: Double zero?
JERRY: DrakeÂ’s Coffee Cake
JERRY: Drawer.
JERRY: Drop one. . . . left!
JERRY: Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat. Tim: Sounds more like Scottish.
JERRY: Duncan Meyers!
JERRY: Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
JERRY: Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars !?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader . I don't think so .
JERRY: Dylan Murphy. George mumbles something.
JERRY: Easy big fella.
JERRY: Eat something! Babu...
JERRY: Echh
JERRY: Eckman? I thought he was doing time?
JERRY: Edmund Fitzgerald.
JERRY: Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
JERRY: Eh, it went okay.
JERRY: Eh, people, people are talking.
JERRY: Eh, show biz...
JERRY: Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer.
JERRY: Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
JERRY: Eh.
JERRY: Eh.
JERRY: Eh. Elaine: You haven't told them yet, have you?
JERRY: Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
JERRY: Ehh, I dunno..
JERRY: Ehh, nobody listens.
JERRY: Either that, or theyÂ’ve got a little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why donÂ’t you just go to the cashier?
JERRY: Either way.
JERRY: Elaaaiinne...
JERRY: Elaine , have you been talking to her?
JERRY: Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces.
JERRY: Elaine ... look! A twenty!
JERRY: Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.
JERRY: Elaine danced?
JERRY: Elaine got a new number because she died.
JERRY: Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
JERRY: Elaine is having a houseguest. She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
JERRY: Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
JERRY: Elaine is writing a sitcom...!
JERRY: Elaine itÂ’s her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
JERRY: Elaine would never borrow that much money! Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I'm in the clear here. Elaine's not moving in! I don't have to confront her! She has no idea I never wanted her to move in.. Im golden!
JERRY: ELAINE!
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: Elaine! No! No!
JERRY: Elaine'll kill me.
JERRY: Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?
JERRY: Elaine's writing a Murphy Brown?
JERRY: Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
JERRY: Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You canÂ’t do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
JERRY: Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
JERRY: Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said Too bad he's gay.
JERRY: Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
JERRY: Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're down. You see how it all evens out for me? Cut to Pendant Publishing
JERRY: Elaine, Elaine... Yeah?
JERRY: Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
JERRY: Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strage the whole flight?
JERRY: Elaine, he doesn't need-
JERRY: Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup
JERRY: Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
JERRY: Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
JERRY: Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me? Elaine: No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
JERRY: Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a Murphy Brown. You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
JERRY: Elaine, let the man make his soup!
JERRY: Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
JERRY: Elaine, now you're being ridiculous. There's a knock at the door.
JERRY: Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
JERRY: Elaine, see this T-shirts, six years I've had this T-shirts, it's my best one, I call him...Golden Boy
JERRY: Elaine, stop it.
JERRY: Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
JERRY: Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
JERRY: Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing here?
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
JERRY: Elaine, what do you think?
JERRY: Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
JERRY: Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
JERRY: Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
JERRY: Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than
JERRY: Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
JERRY: Elaine, you're among friends.
JERRY: Elaine, youÂ’ve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwinÂ’ me on this car, which is yellow now!
JERRY: Elaine.
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Elaine...

JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
JERRY: Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right babydoll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first. Chauffer: I know. Jerry and George: He knows? George: Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
JERRY: Elaine?!
JERRY: Eleven dollars for what?
JERRY: Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
JERRY: Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long trip.
JERRY: Errh.
JERRY: Euhh...Elaine....
JERRY: Evelyn, this is Elaine.
JERRY: Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with
JERRY: Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
JERRY: Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
JERRY: Even more reasonable.
JERRY: Eventually a little shot of penicillin
JERRY: Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..

JERRY: Everyday is my birthday.
JERRY: Everyday.

JERRY: Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
JERRY: Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
JERRY: Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
JERRY: Excuse me, Mother?
JERRY: Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
JERRY: Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
JERRY: Excuse me.
JERRY: Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
JERRY: Excuse me. Excuse me? Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you oh well, what are you deaf?
JERRY: Excuse me.. Mister Benes?
JERRY: Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
JERRY: Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Expect a call.
JERRY: Expecting Newman? That's funny because I happened to find him at Kenny Roger's Roasters.
JERRY: Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
JERRY: Extra teeth . I love that look .
JERRY: Ey, ey!
JERRY: Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
JERRY: Faked 'em all.
JERRY: Family?
JERRY: Famous Original Ray's?
JERRY: Fantastic.
JERRY: Fantastic..
JERRY: Farfel? Attendant #2: It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital, could you take his dog to New York?
JERRY: Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
JERRY: fault. Do you smell smoke?
JERRY: Faux pas.
JERRY: Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
JERRY: Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
JERRY: Feel good.
JERRY: Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment. Jean-Paul: It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep!
JERRY: Few do.
JERRY: Fields. Sidney Fields. 87 years old. 87. How about your guy?
JERRY: Fifty dollars. I don't believe this!
JERRY: Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.
JERRY: Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
JERRY: FinderÂ’s fee? It was on the lot!
JERRY: Fine all done, just looking for the soap. Jerry is looking around for the bottle of fungicide.
JERRY: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
JERRY: Fine, Mrs. Costanza. Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
JERRY: Fine.
JERRY: Fine.
JERRY: Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
JERRY: Fine...
JERRY: Fire drill, can you believe that?
JERRY: Fire engines?
JERRY: Fire station?
JERRY: First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
JERRY: First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring
JERRY: First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
JERRY: First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
JERRY: First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period. George: Well you should have been O'Brien.
JERRY: First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
JERRY: First we ride the cyclone. man: Chilly out.
JERRY: First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
JERRY: Five minutes.
JERRY: Five, ten minutes.
JERRY: Fix a screen door in Queens.
JERRY: Flowers?
JERRY: Fluff and fold. The only way to live. I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
JERRY: Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it,
JERRY: For both of us .
JERRY: For either one of us..
JERRY: For fun.
JERRY: For how long?
JERRY: For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long,
JERRY: For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
JERRY: For the apartment.
JERRY: For what?
JERRY: For what?
JERRY: Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug.
JERRY: Forget it.
JERRY: Forget it.
JERRY: Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
JERRY: Forget the sports jacket.
JERRY: Four hundred a month.
JERRY: Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
JERRY: Fourteen years down the drain.
JERRY: Franco?
JERRY: Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you? Hole Digger: My name is Edgar.
JERRY: Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing. Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.
JERRY: Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
JERRY: Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
JERRY: Fred, do you know Elaine?
JERRY: Fred?
JERRY: Friend of a friend. And you?
JERRY: Friend!
JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.
JERRY: From that woman at NBC?
JERRY: From what?
JERRY: Fungicide. Fungus? At MonkÂ’s.
JERRY: Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
JERRY: Game over. INT. J. PETERMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
JERRY: Game?
JERRY: Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
JERRY: Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
JERRY: Geoffrey who?
JERRY: George - could I have a word?
JERRY: George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
JERRY: George and I went up to NBC and we told them our idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
JERRY: George Costanza...
JERRY: George got him fired. He squealed on him.
JERRY: George has become a hand model.
JERRY: George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
JERRY: George I'm telling ya..
JERRY: George is already in there.
JERRY: George is dating a convict.
JERRY: George is pickin' us up at the airport.
JERRY: George NO!!
JERRY: George was right. Didn't take you long. Kramer enters
JERRY: George!
JERRY: George! Can we focus on the car, here?
JERRY: George's father.
JERRY: George's girlfriend , Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say ,kookie talk. Kramer; You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
JERRY: George, big news; I'm getting married!!
JERRY: George, could you help me, please?
JERRY: George, did you get that chair yet?
JERRY: George, does your father speak Korean?
JERRY: George, George!
JERRY: George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
JERRY: George, george..
JERRY: George, give them to me, I want these keys. I don't want to get physical!
JERRY: George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
JERRY: George, I didn't sleep at all last night.. I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you listening to me? Just put some soap on your finger.. it'll slide right off.. Then try axle grease. I'll call you back after I talk to her. Bye.
JERRY: George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If IÂ’m ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
JERRY: George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
JERRY: George, I'm sorry..
JERRY: George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
JERRY: George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making
JERRY: George, Marla.
JERRY: George, Stacey.
JERRY: George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
JERRY: George, the man wept.
JERRY: George, the phone's free.
JERRY: George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on.
JERRY: George, this is Nina.
JERRY: George, we need to talk.
JERRY: George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
JERRY: George, what's going on?!
JERRY: George, what's the matter with you?
JERRY: George, who is that woman in the stripes?
JERRY: George, you need a medical doctor.
JERRY: George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
JERRY: George.
JERRY: George.
JERRY: George.
JERRY: George. Sorry, weÂ’re just waiting for David Puddy.
JERRY: George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. Wilkinson, the guy who's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he's in the hospital.
JERRY: George...
JERRY: George?
JERRY: George?
JERRY: George? Elaine: No, no
JERRY: George? What are you doin' here?
JERRY: Georgio! Nice duds!
JERRY: Get a march goin'! March it!
JERRY: Get going.
JERRY: Get in the car! Get in the car! George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off. Kramer: O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy? Tim: Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?

JERRY: Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it? Frankie: You don't like the van?
JERRY: Great? Where do you get great?
JERRY: Greatest Show on Earth!

I'm ready. George: Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents? Rhisa: Geor-gie... Frankie, running up to the van and yelling through the window: Is this Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?! Rhisa, hearing Frankie as George runs to the back of the van: Wait. What's he saying? George: I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God! Rhisa: No, they caught him. George, running out and away from the van: I knew it wasn't Berkowitz! Frankie, seeing George running away: Ohh... Elaine: So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.' Jack: Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today. Elaine: Really, what was the first? Jack, pulling out his Wiz hat: They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again. Elaine: What? Jack, dancing around: I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz! Elaine: Well what, what about your fact-checking job? Jack, dancing around: Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me! Jerry, finding Frankie, in his hole, in the woods: Frankie... come on out of there. Frankie: You hate the van.
JERRY: Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
JERRY: Have we even been in public? Jerry is walking away from Lisi and she follows behind him.
JERRY: Have you come across this?
JERRY: Have you ever been through an audit?
JERRY: Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
JERRY: Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
JERRY: Have you ever seen yourself? Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
JERRY: Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
JERRY: Have you noticed people staring at your head?
JERRY: Have you said anything to her about it?
JERRY: Have you slept with him yet?
JERRY: Have you tastes the soup?
JERRY: Have you thought any more about that trip?
JERRY: Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
JERRY: Having her in jail.
JERRY: He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. Alright come on let's play.
JERRY: He asked you to watch them not wear them.
JERRY: He bothers me. I don't even answer the phone anymore because of him. He's turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
JERRY: He called the right guy.
JERRY: He can't do that. KRAMER: It's the only way you'll learn. Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
JERRY: He can't handle the truth!
JERRY: He can't hear us. George: Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
JERRY: He can't just throw me off the plane!
JERRY: He couldn't believe it. George: I said, I said: 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
JERRY: He did it.
JERRY: He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there.
JERRY: He did?
JERRY: He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have
JERRY: He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
JERRY: He didn't make it.
JERRY: He does look like a horse.
JERRY: He doesn't even care if a man answers.

JERRY: He is the gambler.
JERRY: He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about Jerry.
JERRY: He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
JERRY: He knows what he's doing.
JERRY: He lives in a bubble.
JERRY: He looks like a Peanuts character.
JERRY: He might not want nothing.
JERRY: He might want a show about anything and everything.
JERRY: He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
JERRY: He offered it to me.
JERRY: He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
JERRY: He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and
JERRY: He pulled an LBJ on you.
JERRY: He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid. He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this. He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!
JERRY: He said that?
JERRY: He said wuss?
JERRY: He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
JERRY: He say anything?

JERRY: He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
JERRY: He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
JERRY: He wants to talk about Jerry!
JERRY: He was 96 years old.
JERRY: He was buying quite a load of chicken almost for two people, as long as one of them is not him.
JERRY: He was down at the other end. So he yells out, Ready, On your mark, Get set,  and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
JERRY: He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
JERRY: He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
JERRY: He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris. George: I made him up.
JERRY: He was running from a bee.
JERRY: He went back? What do you mean he went back?
JERRY: He went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.

JERRY: He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
JERRY: He's a friend of mine.
JERRY: He's a little backed up.
JERRY: He's a little off the wall.
JERRY: He's a ringer!
JERRY: He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
JERRY: He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly. I would like to have a good show.
JERRY: He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
JERRY: He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
JERRY: He's an importer/exporter.
JERRY: He's back. And I knew he would be someday. Man that's some tart cider!
JERRY: He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy. ELAINE: Oh. I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.

JERRY: He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?
JERRY: He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
JERRY: He's gonna show up anyway.
JERRY: He's good, you're not.
JERRY: He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
JERRY: He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
JERRY: He's joking.
JERRY: He's kind of tied up here.
JERRY: He's like a squirrel.
JERRY: He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket book. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
JERRY: He's new around here. GEORGE: So, details?
JERRY: He's nice, bit of a close talker.
JERRY: He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck! Kramer: I got carpool.  Kramer: Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z. Joey: Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom? Mrs. Zanfino: Mmm, I don't know... Mrs. Zanfino: All right. Kids & Kramer: Yay! Dugan: You're taking the job? Elaine: You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6:00. No, make that six ideas by 4:00. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!  Sensei: Are you prepared for kumite? Kramer & Joey: Yes, sensei. Sensei: Fight stance. Sensei: Hydjama! Begin! Sensei: Winner!  George: It's open! George: Rosses. Mrs. Ross: Hello, George. George: Well, uh... come in, come, come in. Mr. Ross: We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy. George: Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? Mrs. Ross: We know the last three months have been hard on you. George: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard. Mr. Ross: And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children. George: Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do. Mr. Ross: That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory. George: Oh, that's wonderful. Mr. Ross. And, of course, we want you to be an integral part. George: Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral? Mr. Ross: You'll be on the board of directors. George: Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees... Mrs. Ross: Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time. George: I can't believe this is happening. Mr. Ross: Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, She's not really dead if her shadow is... Uh, w-what was it, dear? Mrs. Ross: Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows? Mr. Ross: Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end. Mrs. Ross: So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us? George: The second I see him.
JERRY: He's not after me.
JERRY: He's not that good . Kramer and George at Kramer's apartment
JERRY: He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
JERRY: He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you. Jean-Paul: I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
JERRY: He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one is going in.

JERRY: Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
JERRY: Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff? MILOS: Hey everybody, look! The little chicken girl wants me to ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! Hahaha! Milos strides away to continue the game, leaving Jerry looking rueful. Elaine walks down a hallway, carrying a large grocery bag. She reads numbers off doors until she spots the one she wants. She gives a smile, flicks her hair a little, and knocks at the door. ELAINE: Hello? Vincent? The door cracks open a few inches, but it's completely dark inside, so the occupant can't be seen. VINCENT: Elaine? ELAINE: I got what you asked. VINCENT: Just, leave it and go. ELAINE: W..well, can't I come in? VINCENT: No. Go away. Now.
JERRY: hey, uh.. what'd you get there?

JERRY: Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
JERRY: Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now. Kramer: Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them. Elaine: Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face Postal Employee: May I help you? Kramer: Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail. Postal Employee: Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it? Kramer: Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently. Newman: I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail. Kramer: Oh, yes, I am. Newman: What about your bills? Kramer: The bank can pay 'em. Newman: The bank. What about your cards and letters? Kramer: E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms. Newman: All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you. Supervisor: Is everything all right here, Postal Employee Newman? Newman: Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer? Kramer: Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail! George, surprising his parents in the kitchen: Welcome back. Estelle: Oh! George: Quick for a... catered affair. Frank: I don't know what you mean. George: You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!

Frank: What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time. George: I'm not following. Frank: We're cuttin' you lose. George: You're cuttin' me loose? Frank: Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother. George: They don't want to see me anymore!

JERRY: I am a little freaked out!

JERRY: I am...the master packer.
JERRY: I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, Oh This is so good.

JERRY: I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
JERRY: I believe we're not...

JERRY: I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
JERRY: I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
JERRY: I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this stupid thing.
JERRY: I bought him some kishka.
JERRY: I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
JERRY: I can ball park it.
JERRY: I can do that.
JERRY: I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
JERRY: I can manage. KRAMER: George! KRAMER It'll take you ten seconds.
JERRY: I can see that! What happened?
JERRY: I can see that. What's it for?
JERRY: I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
JERRY: I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
JERRY: I can't believe I do.
JERRY: I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
JERRY: I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!
JERRY: I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one! George: You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
JERRY: I can't believe it-- I got nothing! I don't even know her name!
JERRY: I can't believe it.
JERRY: I can't believe it. He stole my move.
JERRY: I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
JERRY: I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
JERRY: I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
JERRY: I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
JERRY: I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
JERRY: I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?
JERRY: I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
JERRY: I can't believe what I'm hearing.
JERRY: I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
JERRY: I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
JERRY: I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
JERRY: I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. Get this one: I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a

JERRY: I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb!
JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
JERRY: I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
JERRY: I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
JERRY: I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
JERRY: I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
JERRY: I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
JERRY: I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
JERRY: I can't take it.
JERRY: I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman is absolutely mesmerizing.
JERRY: I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
JERRY: I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart. Kramer enters. He flinches when he sees the haircut.
JERRY: I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
JERRY: I can't.
JERRY: I can't.
JERRY: I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
JERRY: I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
JERRY: I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.
JERRY: I can't. Nobody's even listening.
JERRY: I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
JERRY: I can?
JERRY: I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that Breakfast at Tiffany's thing.
JERRY: I cannot take it!
JERRY: I canÂ’t. I got to meet Clare.
JERRY: I canÂ’t. What if he wakes up?
JERRY: I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it.
JERRY: I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
JERRY: I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable.
JERRY: I couldn't
JERRY: I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a magical world of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
JERRY: I couldn't do it without you.
JERRY: I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
JERRY: I couldnÂ’t tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that head start.
JERRY: I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate. A friend of George and Jerry's walks up to the table.
JERRY: I did .
JERRY: I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB. George: What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
JERRY: I did it for you.
JERRY: I did not bail out on you.
JERRY: I did not cheat.
JERRY: I did not!
JERRY: I did something stupid.
JERRY: I did.
JERRY: I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. Six points. It's up six points!
JERRY: I didn't actually want to rent it.
JERRY: I didn't bring anything.
JERRY: I didn't call her till today.
JERRY: I didn't care.
JERRY: I didn't do anything.
JERRY: I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
JERRY: I didn't even know the woman.
JERRY: I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
JERRY: I didn't even use the ticket!
JERRY: I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
JERRY: I didn't hear anything.
JERRY: I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
JERRY: I didn't know any of this.
JERRY: I didn't know he wasn't invited
JERRY: I didn't know it was possible not to know that. GEORGE: How was Eric Roberts as the husband? KRAMER: Oh, unforgettable. GEORGE: Oww. KRAMER: I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug. Kramer opens the door and exits hurriedly. Elaine walks over the 'Vincent' rack, where she finds nothing but copies of a video called Betrayed. ELAINE: What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I... Kramer enters the store and hurries over to Elaine. KRAMER: Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. Yeah, I decided I'm up for it. ELAINE: Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done? The store manager comes over and squeezes past Elaine. MANAGER: Excuse me. The manager removes the 'Vincent' label from the shelf and replaces it with another name. ELAINE: What're you doing? The manager walks back to behind the counter. ELAINE: Wha..wha...? MANAGER: Vincent stopped making picks. ELAINE: Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see? MANAGER: We have a wide variety of Gene picks. ELAINE: Gene's trash. MANAGER: I'm Gene. Elaine looks sick at her error. Kramer smiles and raises his eyebrows. ELAINE: Hi. A subdued Milos is behind the counter, before which stands Jerry.
JERRY: I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come
JERRY: I didn't know she was married.
JERRY: I didn't know she would laugh.
JERRY: I didn't know you meant hold it, I thought you meant hold it.
JERRY: I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
JERRY: I didn't say anything.
JERRY: I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was OK..
JERRY: I didn't see anything.
JERRY: I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
JERRY: I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
JERRY: I didnÂ’t even think to look.
JERRY: I didnÂ’t know what the coma etiquette was.
JERRY: I didnÂ’t open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
JERRY: I do a wash.
JERRY: I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there's nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it's empty and you still have to go through the little maze. Can you get a little piece
JERRY: I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
JERRY: I do.
JERRY: I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her.
JERRY: I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
JERRY: I don't believe it.
JERRY: I don't believe this! Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
JERRY: I don't believe this.
JERRY: I don't believe this.
JERRY: I don't believe this.
JERRY: I don't blame you. I blame myself.
JERRY: I don't bother with him. He's been calling me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if he's paying attention.
JERRY: I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
JERRY: I don't care about it.
JERRY: I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
JERRY: I don't care, why are you telling me this?
JERRY: I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.
JERRY: I don't care.
JERRY: I don't either.
JERRY: I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
JERRY: I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I've met them three times in my life.
JERRY: I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I don't even remember the name of the town.
JERRY: I don't even know?
JERRY: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
JERRY: I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? Just asking.
JERRY: I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
JERRY: I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
JERRY: I don't have any material!
JERRY: I don't have any plants.
JERRY: I don't have it!
JERRY: I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! Yeah?!
JERRY: I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
JERRY: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
JERRY: I don't know about sixty.
JERRY: I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation .
JERRY: I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
JERRY: I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right?
JERRY: I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of pretending to be excited every time it's somebody's birthday, you know what I mean? What is the
JERRY: I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
JERRY: I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow.
JERRY: I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
JERRY: I don't know how I'm going to tell him.
JERRY: I don't know how long this is gonna last.
JERRY: I don't know how this happened.
JERRY: I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,
JERRY: I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
JERRY: I don't know how you do it.
JERRY: I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
JERRY: I don't know if they have land guys.
JERRY: I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down.. I can't decide.
JERRY: I don't know it was weird . Crazy printing . I don't know who it was from .
JERRY: I don't know Kramer, my only concern is that ....
JERRY: I don't know what I was thinking.
JERRY: I don't know what that means.
JERRY: I don't know what this is. Kramer enters and sits at the counter so George is between him and Jerry.
JERRY: I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
JERRY: I don't know what to do.
JERRY: I don't know what to do.
JERRY: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM
JERRY: I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
JERRY: I don't know what you should do with it .
JERRY: I don't know what's happening to me.
JERRY: I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
JERRY: I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
JERRY: I don't know!
JERRY: I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
JERRY: I don't know! It just popped out.
JERRY: I don't know, but we don't have much time.
JERRY: I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
JERRY: I don't know, George.
JERRY: I don't know, Hi.
JERRY: I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
JERRY: I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going to make it, you kind of root it for awhile.
JERRY: I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
JERRY: I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
JERRY: I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
JERRY: I don't know, regular human time?
JERRY: I don't know, she just sits there.
JERRY: I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
JERRY: I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
JERRY: I don't know, this?
JERRY: I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'
JERRY: I don't know, you know, what if...?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.  5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of
JERRY: I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
JERRY: I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or
JERRY: I don't know. All I know he was sniffing.
JERRY: I don't know. Blind date?
JERRY: I don't know. Camera shot on the polygraph. The pen moves back and forth on the paper.
JERRY: I don't know. Camera shot on the polygraph. The pen moves back and forth on the paper. Lou and Sergeant Tierney
JERRY: I don't know. George: Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
JERRY: I don't know. He said he'd call back.
JERRY: I don't know. He's an importer.
JERRY: I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
JERRY: I don't know. It must be love. Monks
JERRY: I don't know. It's got a pink lining.
JERRY: I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
JERRY: I don't know. Nothing.?
JERRY: I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
JERRY: I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
JERRY: I don't know. That's like asking Where's Waldo?
JERRY: I don't know. They're backed up.
JERRY: I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War II. The rent's three hundred a month.
JERRY: I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it?
JERRY: I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
JERRY: I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o' clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone's door and tell them to keep it down? You're really altering your whole self-image, I mean, what am I? Fred Mertz now? What's happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a
JERRY: I don't know. What if I get caught?
JERRY: I don't know. Where have you been?
JERRY: I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
JERRY: I don't know. Why?
JERRY: I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
JERRY: I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their
JERRY: I don't like pesto.
JERRY: I don't like this Kramer . Will it be much longer ?
JERRY: I don't mind the cemetery. George: What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
JERRY: I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
JERRY: I don't need a personal trainer. all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
JERRY: I don't need anymore.
JERRY: I don't read in the bathroom.
JERRY: I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there. And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?
JERRY: I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
JERRY: I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
JERRY: I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
JERRY: I don't see architecture comin from you...
JERRY: I don't see it happening.
JERRY: I don't see Katie anywhere.
JERRY: I don't smell anything.
JERRY: I don't think I am.
JERRY: I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van. Kramer: Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
JERRY: I don't think I'm hungry:
JERRY: I don't think it's that bad.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!
JERRY: I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
JERRY: I don't think so...
JERRY: I don't think that's it.
JERRY: I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
JERRY: I don't think we're gonna make the tip off. Tim: You think someone's been tipped off? George: So, um, you've read The Big Game, have you? Eva: Yes I've read it and I've memorized it. George: Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of The Big Game. Eva: Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man. George: Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids. Tim: Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game. George: Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
JERRY: I don't think you are.
JERRY: I don't think you did anything wrong.
JERRY: I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble, I'll do it myself.
JERRY: I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
JERRY: I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
JERRY: I don't understand this..
JERRY: I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
JERRY: I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
JERRY: I don't wanna be a 32.
JERRY: I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a
JERRY: I don't wanna use your car.
JERRY: I don't wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do ya think?
JERRY: I don't want a van. Elaine: Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
JERRY: I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
JERRY: I don't want any!
JERRY: I don't want cantaloupe now.
JERRY: I DON'T WANT IT ....
JERRY: I don't want it.
JERRY: I don't want it..
JERRY: I don't want the coat.
JERRY: I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy? George: Yes, you have to be Murphy.
JERRY: I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
JERRY: I don't want to stop her!
JERRY: I don't want to talk about it!
JERRY: I don't want to trade. Kramer: No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
JERRY: I don't want to.
JERRY: I don't want you to call him.
JERRY: I don't.
JERRY: I don't...I dunno.
JERRY: I don't...think so.
JERRY: I donÂ’t get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
JERRY: I donÂ’t give out bites. I got another one. But IÂ’m saving it for later.
JERRY: I donÂ’t know.
JERRY: I donÂ’t think so. You know they, theyÂ’re so fragile.
JERRY: I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
JERRY: I dunno A guy suddenly gets up to leave then falls on the ground.
JERRY: I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person.
JERRY: I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
JERRY: I dunno, it was an impulse.
JERRY: I dunno, maybe...
JERRY: I dunno. Hard to say.
JERRY: I dunno. He's so strange.'
JERRY: I dunno. Hey.
JERRY: I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
JERRY: I dunno. Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
JERRY: I dunno...
JERRY: I dunno... Alright, I forgive you...
JERRY: I feel like I'm going to throw up.
JERRY: I feel terrible. I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. I've just got this like, psycho-sexual hold over me. I just want her, I can't breathe. It's like a drug.
JERRY: I find the whole thing very embarrassing.
JERRY: I follow. So what are you gonna do?
JERRY: I forgot about the video.
JERRY: I forgot my toothbrush.
JERRY: I forgot to make my bed.
JERRY: I forgot.
JERRY: I gave a look?
JERRY: I gave you a hundred dollars?!
JERRY: I gave you a taste. What do you want?
JERRY: I get it.
JERRY: I get peeved.
JERRY: I geve your ticket to Horneck.
JERRY: I got a 31 waist, mister!
JERRY: I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner. Kramer drinks.
JERRY: I got a date with Nikki .
JERRY: I got a date with that girl, Lena.
JERRY: I got a date. C'mon, please.
JERRY: I got a haircut.
JERRY: I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
JERRY: I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
JERRY: I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
JERRY: I got no problem with that.
JERRY: I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it's very
JERRY: I got some Cubans for George's wedding . They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell !
JERRY: I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
JERRY: I got the call...!
JERRY: I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out .
JERRY: I got you an apartment in the building.
JERRY: I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
JERRY: I gotta do some research here. Elaine: Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. You did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. You are the doofus.
JERRY: I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
JERRY: I gotta get out of this cab...
JERRY: I gotta get to the airport.
JERRY: I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
JERRY: I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
JERRY: I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
JERRY: I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
JERRY: I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
JERRY: I guess he graduated.
JERRY: I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.
JERRY: I guess I would .
JERRY: I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
JERRY: I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade. MILOS: Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. Wou..would you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man.
JERRY: I guess that's all right.
JERRY: I guess that's true...
JERRY: I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
JERRY: I guess we'll never know. SOME BACK ALLEY
JERRY: I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
JERRY: I guess.
JERRY: I guess...
JERRY: I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
JERRY: I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out. Kramer enters Jerry's apartment with Newman.
JERRY: I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don't get this. Aren't cows ouside most of the time? I don't understand it. When it's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, we're all wearing leather.. Open the door! We're gonna ruin the whole outfit here.. Is it suede? I am
JERRY: I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
JERRY: I had a statue!
JERRY: I had a statue! What should I do?
JERRY: I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
JERRY: I had to do it.
JERRY: I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I'll just make up some excuse why I can't go to the game either.
JERRY: I had to.
JERRY: I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion won't even exist. It won't. I think eventually we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there's people
JERRY: I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker...
JERRY: I hate the counter. Elaine enters and sits at the counter next to Jerry.
JERRY: I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better
JERRY: I have an idea. We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema III.
JERRY: I have an instinct for these things. Closing monologue.
JERRY: I have fleas.
JERRY: I have money. I make money.
JERRY: I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks. Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back.
JERRY: I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life ever.
JERRY: I have no idea.
JERRY: I have no idea.
JERRY: I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. Uhm, I'll be right back.
JERRY: I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.
JERRY: I have some idea.
JERRY: I have some questions of my own . Sheila walks in
JERRY: I have to do what?
JERRY: I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
JERRY: I have to go over to my grandmother's.
JERRY: I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
JERRY: I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never.. I can't imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie.. but that's me.
JERRY: I have to say. Those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
JERRY: I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest.
JERRY: I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
JERRY: I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
JERRY: I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
JERRY: I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. I couldn't help
JERRY: I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
JERRY: I hear it's ah beautiful there.
JERRY: I hear you're going out with David Putty.
JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
JERRY: I heard something.
JERRY: I heard something. Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on Murphy Brown! ELAINE: Kramer's on Murphy Brown!
JERRY: I heard those doves were really incredible.
JERRY: I heard you say something, there.
JERRY: I hired her from a service!
JERRY: I hope so.
JERRY: I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
JERRY: I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.
JERRY: I just met her, she's incredible.
JERRY: I just said that.
JERRY: I just saw them. Oh, here. Here you go. Mr. Pitt: Thank you, young man.
JERRY: I just want to touch them a little.
JERRY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was..
JERRY: I just wanted you to scare him.
JERRY: I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
JERRY: I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house. TURNING TO LIBRARY COUNTER
JERRY: I knew it! I'm not crazy.
JERRY: I know , I know . But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no .
JERRY: I know and on the first tournament of her comeback. Kramer is sitting poised on the sideline. He waves back to the group. George and Elaine gives him a thumbs up. The two players hit the ball back and forth. The ball lands in the net. Kramer springs into action running toward the ball and runs into Monica Sellas. Monica falls to the ground in pain.
JERRY: I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
JERRY: I know enough not to get on them. In the boss' office.
JERRY: I know exactly what's goin to happen tonight. I'm gonna try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through it.
JERRY: I know Finland. They're neutral.
JERRY: I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes. I never heard the end of it....Look at him.
JERRY: I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
JERRY: I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. Nothing!
JERRY: I know look at this
JERRY: I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
JERRY: I know that, Kramer.
JERRY: I know the list...
JERRY: I know the point.
JERRY: I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little
JERRY: I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
JERRY: I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
JERRY: I know what you mean.
JERRY: I know you will.
JERRY: I know!
JERRY: I know!
JERRY: I know! What are you doin' here?!?
JERRY: I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, I'm not going to waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do that's not wasting it?
JERRY: I know, but I'm distracted now.
JERRY: I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
JERRY: I know, but...
JERRY: I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
JERRY: I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
JERRY: I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
JERRY: I know, I feel bad about that... Elaine: I bet your parents were upset, huh?
JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
JERRY: I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: I know, I know...
JERRY: I know, I know... Well, you know.
JERRY: I know, I should've asked her.
JERRY: I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that. George: For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police. George grabs the phone and dials. George: 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens-- Tim re-enters the limo. George: --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will. Tim: We'll be ready in a minute. George: Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something. Tim: With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave. George: Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me? Tim: You are. George: And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again? Tim: You are. George: Good. I think you forgot something. Tim: I'm sorry. George: Good. Now get out. Tim leaves. George: Okay, what are we gonna do?
JERRY: I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different.. sources.
JERRY: I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, check, and late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man. Kramer and Laura start signing to each other. We see confusion from them as they are signing. George puts his forhead on his hand.
JERRY: I know. I'm really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse Rolodex.
JERRY: I know. It's like X-ray vision.
JERRY: I know. Neighbors.
JERRY: I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
JERRY: I know. Pretty steep.
JERRY: I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
JERRY: I know. They're not even related. Elaine, entering Jerry's apartment: Hey. George: Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
JERRY: I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
JERRY: I know.. How about dessert?
JERRY: I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like
JERRY: I like that thing in your hair there.
JERRY: I like the button fly.
JERRY: I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
JERRY: I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
JERRY: I live and breathe my friend. . . . I live and breathe.
JERRY: I look about the same.
JERRY: I love a parade! EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT
JERRY: I love crampbark.
JERRY: I love it when people are complimented on something they're wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. Nice tie. Well,
JERRY: I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and it's got that paper mat on the floor. Like they're so obsessed with cleanliness,
JERRY: I love you, Costanza.
JERRY: I love you, George. Come here.
JERRY: I may have mentioned it.
JERRY: I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy. George: He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault. Tim: Where are you from?
JERRY: I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
JERRY: I mean I have many gay friends...
JERRY: I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.
JERRY: I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it.
JERRY: I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
JERRY: I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
JERRY: I mean the car stinks! George, does the car stink?
JERRY: I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy can write checks to himself right out of my account.
JERRY: I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
JERRY: I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need the clown in his title, as clown? Bozo, the clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo... Cut back to George explaining his situation to Robin.
JERRY: I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
JERRY: I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, That hand should not be on my leg. But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, Would you mind?!
JERRY: I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people...
JERRY: I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
JERRY: I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
JERRY: I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
JERRY: I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it.
JERRY: I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
JERRY: I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
JERRY: I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
JERRY: I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
JERRY: I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything.
JERRY: I mean, you love Susan: , right?
JERRY: I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
JERRY: I met her on an elevator.
JERRY: I met her one time...
JERRY: I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
JERRY: I might need you to get me a soda. -
JERRY: I missed you.
JERRY: I need a miracle.
JERRY: I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
JERRY: I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a little too close to trying on a dress.
JERRY: I never get enough sleep. I stay up late at night, cause I'm Night Guy. Night Guy wants to stay up late. 'What about getting up after five hours sleep?', oh that's Morning Guy's problem. That's not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay up as late as I want. So you get up in the morning, you're ..... , you're exhausted, groggy, oooh I hate that Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning Guy can do. The only Morning Guy can do is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy looses his job and Night Guy has no money to go out anymore.
JERRY: I never really wanted the pen.
JERRY: I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else...
JERRY: I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
JERRY: I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
JERRY: I noticed she's big on the phrase yada yada.
JERRY: I once got Happy new Year in July.
JERRY: I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.
JERRY: I only have a twenty.
JERRY: I only knew you through Moochie.
JERRY: I paid what it costs.
JERRY: I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
JERRY: I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
JERRY: I really don't eat it.
JERRY: I really don't feel like seeing her.
JERRY: I really don't need to look.
JERRY: I really don't see the difference.
JERRY: I really think you're making too much of this.
JERRY: I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
JERRY: I really wanna have some fun.
JERRY: I really wanna...
JERRY: I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
JERRY: I remember that night.
JERRY: I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
JERRY: I resent that you said that! That's directed at me, isn't it?!
JERRY: I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?
JERRY: I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
JERRY: I said I was sorry.
JERRY: I said luss.. I'm at a luss..
JERRY: I said pull over by the stop sign.
JERRY: I said, How come no one's killed her? Probably shouldn't have said anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes. Yeah?
JERRY: I said, never mind.
JERRY: I saw it.
JERRY: I saw one once that could do sign language.
JERRY: I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
JERRY: I see . She's looking .
JERRY: I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview. At Jerry's apartment.
JERRY: I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. The New Yorker is stealing my ideas. ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
JERRY: I sense something is afoot. KRAMER: Yeah, I bought a chicken.
JERRY: I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
JERRY: I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
JERRY: I should have some reason.
JERRY: I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
JERRY: I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
JERRY: I started screaming, There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina. Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. I was little but I could run very fast. I just kept running and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
JERRY: I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
JERRY: I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
JERRY: I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I've got to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
JERRY: I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
JERRY: I suppose you think your bombable .
JERRY: I suppose.
JERRY: I sure do miss my apartment maybe I'll switch back.
JERRY: I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks: e-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh, this man is out of ideas. How does it...? e-e-e-eeeehhhh, I don't think she likes me...The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don't we. Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Where ever women are?, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, OK, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene...That's why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: Where to meet men?. We're here, we are everywhere. We're honking our horns to serve you better.
JERRY: I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
JERRY: I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to
JERRY: I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car With someone with a hairdo like that.
JERRY: I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
JERRY: I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
JERRY: I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human inventions. It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a
JERRY: I think he knew.
JERRY: I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y.
JERRY: I think I got David Duke and Fahrikan down there.
JERRY: I think I got someone!
JERRY: I think I may have made a big mistake.
JERRY: I think I offended the wake-up guy...! Jean-Paul: No, no.
JERRY: I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
JERRY: I think I was tucked.!
JERRY: I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
JERRY: I think I'm in love.
JERRY: I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
JERRY: I think I've seen enough.
JERRY: I think I've seen that look.
JERRY: I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note - it's common courtesy. I don't know, that's just the way I was
JERRY: I think it has something to do with me.
JERRY: I think it's Dutch . I got to get going .
JERRY: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
JERRY: I think it's off the wagon.
JERRY: I think it's the stench of death.
JERRY: I think IÂ’ll take out the garbage.
JERRY: I think IÂ’ve played there.
JERRY: I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
JERRY: I think so.
JERRY: I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
JERRY: I think that if the wedding invitations were left up to the men, we'd just drive around sticking flyers in windshields ...y' know... Not even typed up either,
JERRY: I think that would be a very nice gesture.
JERRY: I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery.
JERRY: I think that's for the best.
JERRY: I think that's it. Sweet fancy Moses!
JERRY: I think that's the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
JERRY: I think the candy comes out over there.
JERRY: I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, it's ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, It's not our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this
JERRY: I think thereÂ’s a mental hospital near here.
JERRY: I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
JERRY: I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
JERRY: I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
JERRY: I think we might have one left in the stock room.
JERRY: I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
JERRY: I think you got it.
JERRY: I think you know my policy.
JERRY: I think you scared me straight.
JERRY: I think you're getting a ticket.
JERRY: I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
JERRY: I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
JERRY: I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
JERRY: I thought I smelled lilac.
JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... There's no milk in here, what...
JERRY: I thought it was open to the public.
JERRY: I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
JERRY: I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
JERRY: I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
JERRY: I thought there were two outs.
JERRY: I thought they wanted to settle.
JERRY: I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
JERRY: I thought we were going out.
JERRY: I thought you didn't want the doormat.
JERRY: I thought you just said she doesn't know??
JERRY: I thought you said it was imminent.
JERRY: I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
JERRY: I thought you saw that already...
JERRY: I thought you stopped talking??
JERRY: I thought you were going out with Celia.
JERRY: I thought you were gonna watch a video.
JERRY: I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
JERRY: I thought you were on strike?
JERRY: I thought you'd be upset.
JERRY: I thought you'd like that.
JERRY: I thought your parents were outta town?
JERRY: I thought youÂ’re like Hitler in the bunker?
JERRY: I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in.
JERRY: I told her about the contest.
JERRY: I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
JERRY: I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
JERRY: I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
JERRY: I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
JERRY: I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
JERRY: I told you to cut it out. Jerry delivers a fierce serve which beats Milos, and almost hits him in the face. MILOS: Hey, c'mon, what're you doing? Huhuh. The baby got lucky on that one! Hahah. Jerry walks back to deliver another serve. Kramer enters and looks around for someone. On another court, Shellbach is facing an automatic serving machine. KRAMER: Shellbach. Shellbach waves vaguely back to Kramer, who has begun to walk round the room to get to him. Meanwhile, Jerry returns a shot to Milos, with some venom. Milos stretches desperately to try and reach it, but loses his grip on his racquet. The racquet arcs across the hall, watched by Patty, and then spotted by Kramer. KRAMER: Racquet. The racquet plummets from the air and strikes the guy who is operating the automatic serving machine for Shellbach. The guy is knocked unconscious and, as he falls, he pushes against the machine, turning it to point at Kramer. Kramer stands transfixed, as it continues to launch balls at him. Several balls in rapid succession strike him in the head, until he slumps, unconscious, to the floor. Aeroplane landing, with a caption 'AKRON, OHIO'. A boardroom very much like that of the Yankees, but with a Firestone sign on the wall. Several people sit around the table, including Reilly, and George, who is filling his face from a large dish of shrimp. REILLY: So, George. You're proposing a snow tyre day at Yankee Stadium? GEORGE: Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. Huhu. Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody. MCADAM: I have to say this, this proposal doesn't make a whole lot of sense. GEORGE: Well, you never know. Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth. George begins picking up shrimp one by one and stuffing them into his mouth. REILLY: You know, George... George looks up, expectantly. REILLY: The ocean called. They're running outta shrimp. Everyone around the table laughs. Except for George, who looks triumphant. He swallows, and uses a napkin to clean his fingers. GEORGE: Oh yeah, Reilly? Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you REILLY: What's the difference? You're their all-time best seller! Reilly and everyone else laughs even more than they did before. George looks angry and frustrated, even on the verge of tears for a second, then something occurs to him. GEORGE: Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife. George looks round, smiling arrogantly, expecting laughter. But there is a deep, uncomfortable, silence. Reilly, looks stony-faced. McAdam stands and leans over to speak in George's ear. MCADAM: His wife is in a coma. George looks sick. Kramer lies in bed, asleep. Jerry sits in a chair, reading a newspaper. There's a knock at the door and Elaine enters, carrying a VCR. ELAINE: Hi. How's he doing?
JERRY: I told you to take it.
JERRY: I told you when I met her..
JERRY: I told you, forget it.
JERRY: I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
JERRY: I tried my best!
JERRY: I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em.
JERRY: I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
JERRY: I try.
JERRY: I understand .
JERRY: I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bimbo broals and pigtails, been counseled by Dick
JERRY: I understand.
JERRY: I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
JERRY: I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
JERRY: I want everyone out!
JERRY: I want that number!
JERRY: I want that picture.
JERRY: I want that rye lady.
JERRY: I want that rye, lady!
JERRY: I want the antidote, pimple popper!
JERRY: I want to but I can't.
JERRY: I want to!
JERRY: I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.
JERRY: I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
JERRY: I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.
JERRY: I was an idiot for listening to you!
JERRY: I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
JERRY: I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
JERRY: I was going to say, Being a good host.
JERRY: I was got to be 55 .
JERRY: I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
JERRY: I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
JERRY: I was kidding when I said that!
JERRY: I was listening!
JERRY: I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys. ELAINE: Why did you let him in?!
JERRY: I was lying, give it to me!
JERRY: I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
JERRY: I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnÂ’t do that.
JERRY: I was out in the snow last night.
JERRY: I was out.
JERRY: I was ready to get jiggy with it. Elaine entering the party with Puddy who's wearing his fur coat.
JERRY: I was saying 'baby' way before George!
JERRY: I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
JERRY: I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
JERRY: I was talking to him.
JERRY: I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
JERRY: I was trying to be.
JERRY: I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
JERRY: I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized.
JERRY: I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
JERRY: I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So
JERRY: I will - don't worry. In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
JERRY: I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.
JERRY: I will.
JERRY: I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there?
JERRY: I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen! INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY
JERRY: I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back . Elaine still on phone
JERRY: I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
JERRY: I wonder what ever happened to her.
JERRY: I wonder.
JERRY: I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
JERRY: I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
JERRY: I would like to know what my name is doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
JERRY: I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George!, George Costanza come in here.
JERRY: I would lose that.
JERRY: I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
JERRY: I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
JERRY: I would think.
JERRY: I wouldn't think so.
JERRY: I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it.
JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
JERRY: I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
JERRY: I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
JERRY: I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
JERRY: I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
JERRY: I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
JERRY: I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.
JERRY: I'd rather not talk about it.
JERRY: I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
JERRY: I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
JERRY: I'll be here.
JERRY: I'll be right back.
JERRY: I'll call an ambulance.
JERRY: I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America!
JERRY: I'll call him. Hello, Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? Will you shut up?! Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye.
JERRY: I'll call you later.
JERRY: I'll drive you to the airport.
JERRY: I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
JERRY: I'll give you a year.
JERRY: I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
JERRY: I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.
JERRY: I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
JERRY: I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
JERRY: I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
JERRY: I'll make them later. Uh.
JERRY: I'll pass.
JERRY: I'll pay for it.
JERRY: I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
JERRY: I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
JERRY: I'll remember that.
JERRY: I'll say.
JERRY: I'll see you later.
JERRY: I'll take the first class.
JERRY: I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir? Prisoner 2: Murder one.
JERRY: I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
JERRY: I'll tell you later.
JERRY: I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
JERRY: I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
JERRY: I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
JERRY: I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
JERRY: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
JERRY: I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
JERRY: I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
JERRY: I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
JERRY: I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
JERRY: I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
JERRY: I'll try and remember that.
JERRY: I'm a comedian.
JERRY: I'm a good printer.
JERRY: I'm a great clicker! Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
JERRY: I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.
JERRY: I'm a joke maker.
JERRY: I'm a little nervous.
JERRY: I'm a nice guy.
JERRY: I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? They're always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal.
JERRY: I'm asking Elaine to marry me. George I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
JERRY: I'm asking!
JERRY: I'm aware of that.
JERRY: I'm banned?!
JERRY: I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
JERRY: I'm blown away.
JERRY: I'm buying you a new sofa.
JERRY: I'm calling Kramer's mother.  I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
JERRY: I'm clean and you know it .
JERRY: I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
JERRY: I'm Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
JERRY: I'm Dylan Murphy. George: I'm Colin O'Brien. They walk towards the chauffer. George: Are we really doing this?
JERRY: I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
JERRY: I'm finding that out.
JERRY: I'm fine. How was the party?
JERRY: I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
JERRY: I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
JERRY: I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass! As Jerry pulls into the one way street, a taxi comes down the street and blocks him in. In the taxi is Elaine.
JERRY: I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
JERRY: I'm glad we had this talk.
JERRY: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Pepperdella's Restaurant
JERRY: I'm goin' home. PAULA: Excuse me? Uh, how much would it cost to clean this?
JERRY: I'm going
JERRY: I'm going for the record.
JERRY: I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
JERRY: I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
JERRY: I'm going to be this guy's friend.
JERRY: I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
JERRY: I'm gonna get that.
JERRY: I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.
JERRY: I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
JERRY: I'm good, thanks.
JERRY: I'm heading over to Elaine's.
JERRY: I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
JERRY: I'm I'm a comedian.
JERRY: I'm in for five...
JERRY: I'm in heaven.
JERRY: I'm in the book and I have a machine.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.
JERRY: I'm just a regular person.
JERRY: I'm just glad it's outta here. What's that?
JERRY: I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. What's the matter, did you call?
JERRY: I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
JERRY: I'm just not getting any hot water.
JERRY: I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
JERRY: I'm just saying..
JERRY: I'm kinda in the middle of something.
JERRY: I'm laying down! Then let's see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
JERRY: I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
JERRY: I'm looking for a crested blazer
JERRY: I'm looking forward to it.
JERRY: I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
JERRY: I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
JERRY: I'm Nelson!
JERRY: I'm no cat killer.
JERRY: I'm not a foodie. I don't, Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty. Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a
JERRY: I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to franks and beans for example.
JERRY: I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I
JERRY: I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? 'Cause you send your money out there - working for you - a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It
JERRY: I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
JERRY: I'm not carrying a purse. Elaine sits down at the table to eat her cereal.
JERRY: I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!
JERRY: I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
JERRY: I'm not engaged. George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small
JERRY: I'm not gay.
JERRY: I'm not getting illegal cable!
JERRY: I'm not giving you her number.
JERRY: I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose-
JERRY: I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
JERRY: I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
JERRY: I'm not going to defile her!
JERRY: I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life. PAULA: I can't fight you.
JERRY: I'm not having money problems.
JERRY: I'm not joking!
JERRY: I'm not kidding.
JERRY: I'm not looking.
JERRY: I'm not lying.
JERRY: I'm not married!
JERRY: I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
JERRY: I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
JERRY: I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?
JERRY: I'm not saying she's deaf, she's deaf.
JERRY: I'm not sending you the bill.
JERRY: I'm not sick. You - you said much sicker things than me.
JERRY: I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk.
JERRY: I'm not sure, but I think she was nice.
JERRY: I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
JERRY: I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
JERRY: I'm not taking it back.
JERRY: I'm not talking about upside down. I'm talking about waking him up!
JERRY: I'm not touching that thing.
JERRY: I'm not wearing the fur.
JERRY: I'm off the project.
JERRY: I'm OK My capillaries burst.
JERRY: I'm on next, right?
JERRY: I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
JERRY: I'm out.
JERRY: I'm paying.
JERRY: I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
JERRY: I'm ready to talk.
JERRY: I'm really sorry.
JERRY: I'm right here.
JERRY: I'm saying get the hell outta there! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call,
JERRY: I'm Seinfeld! George: You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
JERRY: I'm serious about it.
JERRY: I'm serious!
JERRY: I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
JERRY: I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
JERRY: I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train
JERRY: I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
JERRY: I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
JERRY: I'm sorry too.
JERRY: I'm sorry, I..
JERRY: I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...
JERRY: I'm sorry, really.
JERRY: I'm sorry, uh,
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: I'm sorry. ANNOUNCER ON P.A. SYSTEM: Your attention please...the New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut, Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota, all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City.
JERRY: I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
JERRY: I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
JERRY: I'm sorry. You got any booze? Let's say you and I get ripped!
JERRY: I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
JERRY: I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
JERRY: I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
JERRY: I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
JERRY: I'm swamped.
JERRY: I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
JERRY: I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
JERRY: I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
JERRY: I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
JERRY: I'm telling and you can't stop me!
JERRY: I'm telling you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi on the table.
JERRY: I'm telling you man, I'm losing it. Kramer gets off the bus, carrying a garbage bag.
JERRY: I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
JERRY: I'm telling you.
JERRY: I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
JERRY: I'm there for you.
JERRY: I'm too tired. KRAMER: OK, listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
JERRY: I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
JERRY: I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
JERRY: I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. So, you want a protein shake, or something?
JERRY: I'm with you.
JERRY: I'm working in Atlantic City.
JERRY: I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits.
JERRY: I've been defaced!
JERRY: I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing -
JERRY: I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
JERRY: I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? A real dermatologist.
JERRY: I've got a ballpark.
JERRY: I've got a black eye.
JERRY: I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.
JERRY: I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
JERRY: I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
JERRY: I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
JERRY: I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
JERRY: I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!
JERRY: I've never been called breathtaking either.
JERRY: I've never done it before .
JERRY: I've never had a really good pickle.
JERRY: I've seen her in your building.
JERRY: I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
JERRY: I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
JERRY: I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
JERRY: I, I'm sorry.
JERRY: I, uh...well...
JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyÂ’re going to look at a thing like this.
JERRY: I.. no, I don't want to go.
JERRY: I... don't... know...
JERRY: I...am not taking it.
JERRY: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
JERRY: If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
JERRY: If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
JERRY: If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
JERRY: If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
JERRY: If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?
JERRY: If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
JERRY: If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
JERRY: If I'm gonna live over there, you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out. I feel like its gonna
JERRY: If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
JERRY: If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.
JERRY: If only the coin hadn't hit the table.
JERRY: If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
JERRY: If they like each other.
JERRY: If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
JERRY: If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
JERRY: If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
JERRY: If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
JERRY: If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no Yeah?
JERRY: If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
JERRY: If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
JERRY: If you'll excuse me. Jerry bolts through the kitchen door, presumably towards the stage.
JERRY: Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
JERRY: Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
JERRY: Imagine, spelling Mom with two O's...
JERRY: Impossible, right?
JERRY: In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
JERRY: In a manner of speaking.
JERRY: In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
JERRY: In case of what?
JERRY: In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
JERRY: In other words, a normal relationship.
JERRY: In the freezer.
JERRY: In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
JERRY: In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
JERRY: In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
JERRY: In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
JERRY: In your way.
JERRY: Indeed.
JERRY: Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine.. And you are it!
JERRY: Inside out! Great.
JERRY: Inside the van? Frankie: It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive?
JERRY: Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
JERRY: Intervention.
JERRY: Into the patient, literally!
JERRY: Investigation ?
JERRY: Irish money?
JERRY: Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie?
JERRY: Irked?
JERRY: is beating the bushes-
JERRY: Is getting married!
JERRY: Is he being coy?
JERRY: Is he from the future?
JERRY: Is he okay?
JERRY: Is he on the plane now?
JERRY: Is he smart?
JERRY: Is he still in town?
JERRY: Is it a good one?
JERRY: Is it a lot of cream soups?
JERRY: Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
JERRY: Is it better than mine?
JERRY: Is it Famous Ray's?
JERRY: Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
JERRY: Is it me?
JERRY: Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
JERRY: Is it padded?
JERRY: Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
JERRY: Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
JERRY: Is it something I said?
JERRY: Is my toaster oven on there?
JERRY: Is she nice?
JERRY: Is someone there? Mr. Marbles?
JERRY: Is taht still from the cats?
JERRY: Is that a fact?
JERRY: Is that bothering you?
JERRY: Is that Burt Reynolds ?
JERRY: Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. [zips his bag with
JERRY: Is that Joe Davola?
JERRY: Is that my paper?
JERRY: Is that my towel?
JERRY: Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
JERRY: Is that right?
JERRY: Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: is that so?
JERRY: Is that something you want to do?
JERRY: Is that the end of it?
JERRY: Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
JERRY: Is that uh, other apartment still available.
JERRY: Is that what the doctor said?
JERRY: Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
JERRY: Is that your chicken making all that noise?
JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
JERRY: Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
JERRY: Is this a repeat?
JERRY: Is this about me?
JERRY: Is this even a road?
JERRY: Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?
JERRY: Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
JERRY: Is this my stereo ? Kramer walks in
JERRY: Is this okay? Can I do this?
JERRY: Is this really necessary?
JERRY: Is this the proper venue?
JERRY: Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
JERRY: Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working. Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face.
JERRY: Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
JERRY: Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
JERRY: Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
JERRY: Isn't it Myanmar now? Elaine: Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
JERRY: Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
JERRY: Isn't that against the law?
JERRY: Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
JERRY: Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
JERRY: Isn't there a deductible?
JERRY: It appears that way.
JERRY: It can't be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
JERRY: It certainly has.
JERRY: It completely turned her off.
JERRY: It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
JERRY: It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
JERRY: It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
JERRY: It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
JERRY: It doesn't work like that.
JERRY: It doesn't?
JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity.
JERRY: It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
JERRY: It hit her in the head!
JERRY: It is exciting.
JERRY: It is kind of silly.
JERRY: It is not!
JERRY: It is pretty hard to justify, at this point in history, the existence of men and their handkerchiefs. I mean, they open it up, blow their nose in it, and then put it back
JERRY: It is unbelievable.
JERRY: It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
JERRY: It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
JERRY: It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
JERRY: It makes no sense now, me being Murphy. George: You're Murphy!
JERRY: It means he's lying.
JERRY: It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
JERRY: It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then our brains will work.
JERRY: It smells like the beach.
JERRY: It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
JERRY: It sounds like an excellent idea.
JERRY: It still smells!
JERRY: It stinks.
JERRY: It sure is.
JERRY: It very bad.
JERRY: It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig. George: It was a good jig.
JERRY: It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien. George: There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
JERRY: It was a bisque.
JERRY: It was a gift.
JERRY: It was a good bit in the Â‘80Â’s, and itÂ’s still relatable today.
JERRY: It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse ha's. You know those?
JERRY: It was a joke...
JERRY: It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
JERRY: It was a mistake.
JERRY: It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
JERRY: It was a scratch.
JERRY: It was a wonderful reading.
JERRY: It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand.. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. She's gone. Then you come in, Why don't you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You've got five thousand. Give her five thousand.
JERRY: It was embarrassing to me.
JERRY: It was funny!
JERRY: It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
JERRY: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
JERRY: It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a pony!
JERRY: It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
JERRY: It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
JERRY: It was nice meeting you, real pleasure!
JERRY: It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go.
JERRY: It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
JERRY: It was sold out!
JERRY: It was stupid of me.
JERRY: It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
JERRY: It was the single worst moment of my life.
JERRY: It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
JERRY: It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.
JERRY: It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it? Elaine: Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him? George: Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
JERRY: It would be nice to care about someone.
JERRY: It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
JERRY: It's a bet.
JERRY: It's a good mirror... So, what are ya gettin'?
JERRY: It's a haaazy mystery.
JERRY: It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
JERRY: It's a joke.
JERRY: It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
JERRY: It's a list of excuses, it's for that guy, Horneck, who's at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and i don't have to see him. I need it. What are you doing?
JERRY: It's a lotta gum!
JERRY: It's a mammal.
JERRY: It's a must lie situation.
JERRY: It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
JERRY: It's a pig at a complain department.
JERRY: It's a schnoz.
JERRY: It's a simple question...
JERRY: It's a tad dainty.
JERRY: It's a tell. You gotta tell.
JERRY: It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants.
JERRY: It's a very complicated area.
JERRY: It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
JERRY: It's against the law.
JERRY: It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. He got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
JERRY: It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
JERRY: It's all taken care of.
JERRY: It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
JERRY: It's alright, I want you to have it.
JERRY: It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
JERRY: It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
JERRY: It's apples and oranges..
JERRY: It's at the jeweler.
JERRY: It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
JERRY: It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
JERRY: It's been years!
JERRY: It's better than Dondi.
JERRY: It's brown.
JERRY: It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
JERRY: It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
JERRY: It's Dolores. George: Who?
JERRY: It's early.
JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
JERRY: It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
JERRY: It's European.
JERRY: It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And ... good luck!
JERRY: It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
JERRY: It's George.
JERRY: It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
JERRY: It's good to have you back.
JERRY: It's good to see you.
JERRY: It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish three days.
JERRY: It's green.
JERRY: It's hard enough living next door.
JERRY: It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
JERRY: It's hard to say.
JERRY: It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the
JERRY: It's inhumane!
JERRY: It's Jerry.
JERRY: It's just a drawing.
JERRY: It's just hair.
JERRY: It's just unbelievable.
JERRY: It's just...
JERRY: It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
JERRY: It's kind of cozy.
JERRY: It's kinda private.
JERRY: It's Kramer isn't it? The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
JERRY: It's like 10 minutes by subway.
JERRY: It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
JERRY: It's like this all the time.
JERRY: It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone .
JERRY: It's like watching an animal get tortured.
JERRY: It's like we're living in the '50s here.
JERRY: It's like when someone dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
JERRY: It's never happend to me before.
JERRY: It's not a purse. It's European!
JERRY: It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
JERRY: It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah
JERRY: It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a
JERRY: It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She waore this orange dress. It was the first time I
JERRY: It's not legitimate.
JERRY: It's not like she's in the movie.
JERRY: It's not like that at all.
JERRY: It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
JERRY: It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in a second.
JERRY: It's not that bright orange one is it?
JERRY: It's not totally impossible .
JERRY: It's not true!
JERRY: It's not.
JERRY: It's okay
JERRY: It's okay.
JERRY: It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
JERRY: It's on the door.
JERRY: It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that.
JERRY: It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
JERRY: It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
JERRY: It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
JERRY: It's only nine o clock.
JERRY: It's over?
JERRY: It's partially you, yeah.
JERRY: It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
JERRY: It's Patty.
JERRY: It's pompous.
JERRY: It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. How can you defend that?
JERRY: It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
JERRY: It's raining? It's raining. The game will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow.
JERRY: It's routine surgery.
JERRY: It's silly!
JERRY: It's still bleak.
JERRY: It's subtle.
JERRY: It's Sunday. George: Why is the mailman wearing a bucket? Kramer: Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution. George: Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
JERRY: It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
JERRY: It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her. Kramer: Oh I see. Woof! Elaine: You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company! Kramer: Well, then I was way off! Elaine: Well, I'll see ya...
JERRY: It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part
JERRY: It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
JERRY: It's too far.
JERRY: It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
JERRY: It's tremendous.
JERRY: It's true.
JERRY: It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
JERRY: It's unheard of ...
JERRY: It's very good cantaloupe. So that's it? You're out?
JERRY: It's very good.
JERRY: It's wonderful.
JERRY: It's working. Don't tap on the glass.
JERRY: It's your Christmas present.
JERRY: It, uh, rhymes with a female body part.
JERRY: ItÂ’ll take two seconds.
JERRY: ItÂ’s mostly water weight.
JERRY: IÂ’ll be right back.
JERRY: IÂ’ll give you 50 cents.
JERRY: IÂ’m getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. IÂ’m getting another call, see ya
JERRY: IÂ’m just so glad itÂ’s back.
JERRY: IÂ’m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
JERRY: Jane's topless.
JERRY: Jean-Paul!
JERRY: Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you
JERRY: Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: Jerry!
JERRY: Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend.
JERRY: Jerry.
JERRY: Jerry.
JERRY: Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
JERRY: Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
JERRY: Jim Fowler? The animal guy from Wild Kingdom is coming to your apartment?
JERRY: Jimmy
JERRY: Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.. George comes in and sits down with them..
JERRY: Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich.
JERRY: Jimmy?
JERRY: Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
JERRY: John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
JERRY: Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
JERRY: Just - just park yourself. Alright. Act I, Scene A.
JERRY: Just . . . do it.
JERRY: Just a huge massive coronary.
JERRY: Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst
JERRY: Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
JERRY: Just break up with him?
JERRY: Just chatting. Friendly.
JERRY: Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
JERRY: Just forget it. Let it go.
JERRY: Just forget it. Let it go.
JERRY: Just go back and ask him again.
JERRY: Just had a big bowl of Kix.
JERRY: Just imports, no exports?
JERRY: Just in time for Amy.
JERRY: Just keeps on getting better and better.
JERRY: Just lie down.
JERRY: Just like that?
JERRY: Just me? George: Yeah.
JERRY: Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I didn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thing
JERRY: Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's
JERRY: Just put it under your shirt.
JERRY: Just swallow 'em.
JERRY: Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
JERRY: Just what you want to see, yeah. . . . You want to trade your hair for some phlegm
JERRY: Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
JERRY: Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I'm sorry. I din't mean it. I took it out on you. We're still friends. We're still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, I'll tell you what. I've got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
JERRY: Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
JERRY: Just, look, just give the keys.
JERRY: Keep going.
JERRY: Keep it.
JERRY: Keep your shirt on. I got it.
JERRY: Killed?
JERRY: Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
JERRY: Knicks? Rangers?
JERRY: Know what?
JERRY: Koko? INT. MONK'S RESTAURANT - DAY
JERRY: Kom Pau(sp? Kramer tastes the chicken but realizes too late how hot and spicy it his
JERRY: Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
JERRY: Kramer called you?
JERRY: Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.
JERRY: Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
JERRY: Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
JERRY: Kramer says it's up to the cat now. It'll be on your conscience.
JERRY: Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
JERRY: Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
JERRY: Kramer won't sell.
JERRY: Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
JERRY: Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: Kramer! The stone!
JERRY: Kramer! What are you doing?!
JERRY: Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
JERRY: Kramer!!
JERRY: Kramer!!!
JERRY: Kramer's cooking up some corduroy .
JERRY: Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
JERRY: Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
JERRY: Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
JERRY: Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
JERRY: Kramer, bumper-cars?
JERRY: Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.
JERRY: Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
JERRY: Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
JERRY: Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
JERRY: Kramer, get outta my way!
JERRY: Kramer, give me that rooster!
JERRY: Kramer, he's just a dentist.
JERRY: Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I can't wear this!
JERRY: Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
JERRY: Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
JERRY: Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
JERRY: Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
JERRY: Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball boys, not ball men. There are no ball men.
JERRY: Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
JERRY: Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
JERRY: Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
JERRY: Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
JERRY: Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the exit.
JERRY: Kramer, let's do this later.
JERRY: Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
JERRY: Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
JERRY: Kramer, should I call Susan?
JERRY: Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
JERRY: Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
JERRY: Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
JERRY: Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
JERRY: Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
JERRY: Kramer, what are you doing here!?
JERRY: Kramer, what did you do?
JERRY: Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
JERRY: Kramer, what the hell did you do?
JERRY: Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
JERRY: Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
JERRY: Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
JERRY: Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! GEORGE: What was that all about?
JERRY: Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
JERRY: Kramer, you're fighting children?! Kramer: We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
JERRY: Kramer, you're still on the phone? INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
JERRY: Kramer, you've had this thing under control for almost three years now. Don't start again.
JERRY: Kramer.
JERRY: Kramer.
JERRY: Kramer.
JERRY: Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
JERRY: Kramer. knock, knock, knock Kramer. At the entrance of the church. There is a sign there. It reads:
JERRY: Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
JERRY: Kramer...
JERRY: Kramer...
JERRY: Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
JERRY: Kramer?
JERRY: Kramer?
JERRY: Kramer? Cut to Kramer losing control of the truck.
JERRY: Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
JERRY: L.A.?
JERRY: La la la.
JERRY: Larry, wait, you don't understand!
JERRY: Laundry-day is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: C'mon babe, let's gather. You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: ...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here! The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road . They got buttons sowed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughtta get the harpoon out your chest first.
JERRY: Laura.
JERRY: Lean your head back. Open your mouth! Open your mouth! Open it! Open it! (Jerry forces the pill into Kramer's mouth, then holds Kramer's mouth shut for a few moments. Thinking Kramer's already swallowed it, he lets go. Instantly, Kramer
JERRY: Leave a message, I'll call you back.
JERRY: Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
JERRY: Leave it. What about your back?
JERRY: Leave me alone.
JERRY: Lemme call Elaine and Kramer. George: If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
JERRY: Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
JERRY: Leo's furious. What is that doing on the table?
JERRY: Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
JERRY: Leo, I saw you steal.
JERRY: Leo..
JERRY: Leo?
JERRY: Leroy
JERRY: Let go!
JERRY: Let go, Elaine!
JERRY: Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! So what would you do?
JERRY: Let me ask you a question.
JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
JERRY: Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
JERRY: Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
JERRY: Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal. You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn't understand.
JERRY: Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, they go to the next show.
JERRY: Let me have a look at this thing.
JERRY: Let me just get my jacket.
JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink.
JERRY: Let me see those. Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
JERRY: Let me see.
JERRY: Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
JERRY: Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
JERRY: Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen and tell your chef I want the works.
JERRY: Let me walk you to a cab.
JERRY: Let us pray.
JERRY: Let's ask him.
JERRY: Let's do it.
JERRY: Let's get outta here. I'll see ya.
JERRY: Let's get the check. Is this considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
JERRY: Let's go.
JERRY: Let's go.
JERRY: Let's just make a run for it. George: I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
JERRY: Let's put him over here. Kramer: Where are you going?
JERRY: Let's see what he says.
JERRY: Lets hear yours.
JERRY: Lets talk about that.
JERRY: Levels?
JERRY: Like a frightened turtle!
JERRY: like a shark fisherman with a bucket of Ch....
JERRY: Like a shrimp farmer....
JERRY: Like fire in a school is such a big deal.
JERRY: Like the Batman villain?
JERRY: Like this? You just said, you wanted to live here.
JERRY: Like toothpaste?
JERRY: Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
JERRY: Like who?
JERRY: Like with dogs.
JERRY: Line two?
JERRY: Lip-area.
JERRY: Lippman? Elaine Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh,
JERRY: Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything! She buzzes him up.
JERRY: Listen buddy,
JERRY: Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
JERRY: Listen, George, little problem with the game.
JERRY: Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
JERRY: Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
JERRY: Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
JERRY: Listen, Joel. There's something I have to tell you.
JERRY: Listen, Ma... MERYL: It was in here yesterday!
JERRY: Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
JERRY: Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
JERRY: Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just recede into the night, if you know what I mean.
JERRY: Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
JERRY: Live together?
JERRY: Living or all time?
JERRY: Lloyd.
JERRY: Lloyd? He moves across the lobby, slowly, holding his hands out to feel for obstacles.
JERRY: Lloyd? Jerry leaves.
JERRY: Loleola?
JERRY: Loni Anderson.
JERRY: Look at my picture! The photograph has been crudely vandalised with a magic marker.
JERRY: Look at that guy. I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
JERRY: Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?
JERRY: Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for one day...
JERRY: Look at the size of his bird!
JERRY: Look at the size of that neon light.
JERRY: Look at this
JERRY: Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
JERRY: Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
JERRY: Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
JERRY: Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
JERRY: Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
JERRY: Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
JERRY: Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
JERRY: Look at you, you're still thinking about it, I'll never feel comfortable.
JERRY: Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on.
JERRY: Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
JERRY: Look at your skin.
JERRY: Look out!
JERRY: Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
JERRY: Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what? Kramer, breaking the antenna: Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
JERRY: Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
JERRY: Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
JERRY: Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
JERRY: Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
JERRY: Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
JERRY: Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
JERRY: Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
JERRY: Look, I'm sorry-
JERRY: Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
JERRY: Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
JERRY: Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.
JERRY: Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
JERRY: Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
JERRY: Look, my friend saw you.
JERRY: Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
JERRY: Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
JERRY: Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
JERRY: Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
JERRY: Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
JERRY: Look, you're a nice guy, it's just that - we don't have anything in common.
JERRY: Look.
JERRY: Look...look at this can of tuna!
JERRY: Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
JERRY: Looks like a swan.
JERRY: Looks like he gave you some Novocaine
JERRY: Looks like there is?
JERRY: Looters.
JERRY: Lopper. He quickly runs back up to Lisi's building and yells into her intercom system.
JERRY: Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
JERRY: Lord of the manor.
JERRY: Lose that? That's not a Hollywood expression!
JERRY: Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
JERRY: Love that Bobka.
JERRY: Love you.
JERRY: Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
JERRY: Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
JERRY: Ma!
JERRY: Ma! Ma! MA!
JERRY: Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
JERRY: Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan. Okay, bye. My mother.. She forgot how to make French Toast. You know how mothers are.
JERRY: Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
JERRY: Ma, it's not true! Mr. S: It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!
JERRY: Ma, will you go already?
JERRY: Ma, will you stop?
JERRY: Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! Dad, she's cheating!
JERRY: Ma.
JERRY: Madeline stays here. George enters.
JERRY: Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
JERRY: Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
JERRY: Make them interesting.
JERRY: Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender!
JERRY: Mammal.
JERRY: Man that thing is noisy!
JERRY: Manly.
JERRY: Manny..
JERRY: Marine biology.
JERRY: Marla, Kramer.
JERRY: Marla?
JERRY: Marlene
JERRY: Maroon Golf.
JERRY: Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
JERRY: Martine?
JERRY: Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss. Mary moves to avoid Jerry.
JERRY: Matthew, Luke, Paul, what youÂ’re cheating on your conversion chest?
JERRY: May I see you outside for a moment please?
JERRY: May I?
JERRY: Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is. George leaves.
JERRY: Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
JERRY: Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
JERRY: Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
JERRY: Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
JERRY: Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
JERRY: Maybe he knows O'Brien? George: No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
JERRY: Maybe he looks a little like Sugar Ray Leonard.
JERRY: Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
JERRY: Maybe he'll write a song about you.
JERRY: Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
JERRY: Maybe I am .
JERRY: Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.
JERRY: Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
JERRY: Maybe I will.
JERRY: Maybe I'll check out France.
JERRY: Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
JERRY: Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
JERRY: Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
JERRY: Maybe it's a shortcut. George: We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
JERRY: Maybe it's in the lost and found.
JERRY: Maybe that's why she's happy. Kramer enters. He has a handful of flyers.
JERRY: Maybe the fat camp. You're not going?
JERRY: Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y'know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she's probably screamin' at those aliens, I
JERRY: Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
JERRY: Maybe they've all been faking.
JERRY: Maybe this isn't my coat.
JERRY: Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
JERRY: Maybe we should call this off.
JERRY: Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
JERRY: Maybe you can just go back.
JERRY: Maybe you didn't see him.
JERRY: Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
JERRY: Maybe you should date the mothers.
JERRY: Maybe you're getting' a raise.
JERRY: Maybe you're right.
JERRY: Maybe!

JERRY: Me either.

JERRY: Medium crab bisque.
JERRY: Medium crab bisque.
JERRY: Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
JERRY: Men definitely hit the remote button more than women... TOBY: Oh, really! Really! That is so true!
JERRY: Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, Rerun, don't wanna watch it..  What are you watching? I don't care, I gotta keep going. Who was that? I don't know what it
JERRY: Meryl Streep?
JERRY: Mickey Mantle?
JERRY: Middle drawer.
JERRY: Midnight Express, my friend.
JERRY: Miffed.
JERRY: Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing. MILOS: Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore.

JERRY: Mohair, I think.
JERRY: Moisture?
JERRY: Mom, Dad.....I have fleas..
JERRY: Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
JERRY: Mom, I'm not married.
JERRY: Mom, you too?
JERRY: More cereals? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
JERRY: More everything! Does that include Rabbi-slaughtered bovines?
JERRY: More heavy gravy?
JERRY: More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
JERRY: Morning.
JERRY: Most men like working on things, tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy's out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies.
JERRY: Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
JERRY: Mother of God. George: One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
JERRY: Move it! Move it! Get going!
JERRY: Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
JERRY: Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.

JERRY: Music?
JERRY: Must I?
JERRY: My act? What does that have to do with anything?
JERRY: My Aunt's name is Mulva. She's a masseuse.
JERRY: My bet? All right.. I'll open with a tuna sandwich.
JERRY: My cable hook-up? What about it?
JERRY: My car!
JERRY: My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee, and in that second - ruined my life.
JERRY: My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin'
JERRY: My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
JERRY: My foot fell asleep.

JERRY: My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
JERRY: My mother's.
JERRY: My pants!
JERRY: My parents are moving back too!
JERRY: My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, and that's the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, Let's go Pop, white belt, white pants, white
JERRY: My show from last night.
JERRY: My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie.
JERRY: My what? Elaine: Jeannie... your fiancee.
JERRY: My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
JERRY: My, isn't this an awkward moment?
JERRY: Myanmar. Kramer: The discount pharmacy? Elaine: Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog. Kramer: Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? What, you don't have enough experience? Oh, you're not smart enough? Where's your confidence? Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate... Elaine: Karate? Kramer: Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra. Elaine: Katra? Kramer: Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, Yes, I can!
JERRY: N-na I'm paying for the trip.
JERRY: Na..
JERRY: Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song.
JERRY: Nah!
JERRY: Nah, don't bother.
JERRY: Nah, forget it.
JERRY: Nah, he didn't make it.
JERRY: Nah, I don't think so.
JERRY: Nah, I don't wanna
JERRY: Nah, I donÂ’t go for these non-refundable deals. I canÂ’t commit to a woman. IÂ’m not going to commit to an airline.
JERRY: Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
JERRY: Nah, it's not for me.
JERRY: Nah, IÂ’ll go get the robe.
JERRY: Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
JERRY: Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask her.
JERRY: Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
JERRY: Nah. IÂ’ll just wear the pajamas.
JERRY: Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city. Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner. Kramer: I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it. Elaine: I'm sure he was just joking around. Kramer: Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes! Elaine: What is it? Kramer: Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union! Elaine: Jerry's a nazi?! Kramer: I can't believe I didn't see it. Elaine: Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi. Kramer: You don't think so. Elaine: No, he's just neat. Cut back to the limo. Tim: You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien. George: Me?? George and Jerry laugh nervously. Tim: And you really don't look like a Murphy.
JERRY: Nah. You two go.
JERRY: Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
JERRY: Nancy Klopper?
JERRY: Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
JERRY: NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
JERRY: NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.

JERRY: Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. I think the busboy's in trouble.
JERRY: Nice looking Lugar. New scene. Jodi Baskerville, reporting live. Jodi: I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio. Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner. Kramer: Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien? A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized Elaine. Dan: Elaine? Elaine: Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you? Dan: Good. Elaine: Um, oh, this is um, Kramer. Dan: Oh, Kramer? They shake hands. Elaine: What's going on? Dan: Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come. Elaine: Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game. Dan: Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door. Elaine: Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you. Dan: Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like. Kramer: Who? Dan: The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien. Cut back to the limo. Jerry and George are alone inside.
JERRY: Nice to meet ya! Jerry is lying on the couch while Lisi paces behind.
JERRY: Nice to meet you. This is Elaine.
JERRY: Nice try.
JERRY: Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night. crash

JERRY: No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
JERRY: No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
JERRY: No itÂ’s
JERRY: No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
JERRY: No kidding... Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
JERRY: No kidding?
JERRY: No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
JERRY: No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.
JERRY: No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
JERRY: No lines.
JERRY: No more crutches, that must be a relief.

JERRY: No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy. Kramer, showing Jerry his mailbox: Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
JERRY: No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
JERRY: No! That's the wrong doll!

JERRY: No, absolutely nothing. You're fantastic! Hey guys!
JERRY: No, actually I was just...
JERRY: No, because it's so stupid. Shall we? Keri handing him a bunch of miscellaneous items that would seem to normally go in her purse.
JERRY: No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
JERRY: No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
JERRY: No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
JERRY: No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
JERRY: No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
JERRY: No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
JERRY: No, but thank you.
JERRY: No, but the difference is unnoticeable.
JERRY: No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
JERRY: No, c'mon Kramer. Gimme that picture.
JERRY: No, cab's comin' in right here Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
JERRY: No, certainly not. Elaine: I mean, I can't give people orders!
JERRY: No, come on!
JERRY: No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing. Jerry and George walk and meet Elaine and Wendy. Wendy greets Jerry
JERRY: No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it.
JERRY: No, for both!
JERRY: No, forget it.
JERRY: No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
JERRY: No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
JERRY: No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can't wait to get it cleaned.
JERRY: No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
JERRY: No, gore-tex. It's new. Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
JERRY: No, he didn't show up.
JERRY: No, he didn't use 'man'.
JERRY: No, he doesn't.
JERRY: No, he just doesn't like me.
JERRY: No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
JERRY: No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed. Elaine: It could be very confusing. The limo phone rings Kramer answers it. Kramer: Yeah? Eva? Eva: It's for me. Hello? It's O'Brien. Kramer: O'Brien? Well that's weird. Eva: Who are you? George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car broke down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport. Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live. Jodi: A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene. Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of the three are intelligible at this point. Jodi: They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance. Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming unnerved. Eva: Get out!! Elaine: Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan! Dan: Elaine? Elaine: Hey! Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'. George: I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!! Closing monologue. So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie and there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies always had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they would do and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil, remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how are ya, is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the copier? Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, nice to see ya, can I have one of those donuts? End.Transcribed by: Matt Dittloff

JERRY: No, he's still stuck at the foundation. Kramer: You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
JERRY: No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter - pause - Oh no!

JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: No, I don't. Elaine: So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
JERRY: No, I donÂ’t think so. IÂ’ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. ItÂ’s kismet.
JERRY: No, I donÂ’t.
JERRY: No, I guess she's still mad.
JERRY: No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to tell you.
JERRY: No, I hadn't noticed.
JERRY: No, I haven't heard anything.

JERRY: No, I mean, I don't think so.
JERRY: No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don't know her name.
JERRY: No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
JERRY: No, I read in the paper..
JERRY: No, I think I would have remembered Memma.

JERRY: No, I'll be back.
JERRY: No, I'll go. I'm going.
JERRY: No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners with him.
JERRY: No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
JERRY: No, I'm fine.
JERRY: No, I'm gonna take my car.
JERRY: No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
JERRY: No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
JERRY: No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
JERRY: No, I'm not...
JERRY: No, I'm okay.
JERRY: No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
JERRY: No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10:30.
JERRY: No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping. Eva: Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter.
JERRY: No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening. Buzzer
JERRY: No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
JERRY: No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
JERRY: No, it isn't. I can find out.
JERRY: No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
JERRY: No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
JERRY: No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
JERRY: No, it's not that.
JERRY: No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided.
JERRY: No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
JERRY: No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.
JERRY: No, it's part of the contest rules.
JERRY: No, it's supposed to be really bad, really bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard.
JERRY: No, itÂ’s not you. ItÂ’s your stomach, heÂ’s taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. Hello-o-o-o.
JERRY: No, just Meryl.
JERRY: No, Katie, don't--
JERRY: No, keep it.
JERRY: No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him
JERRY: No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, heÂ’s treatinÂ’ me just like a regular customer, now!
JERRY: No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
JERRY: No, let's just do it. What? What is going on? What is that about?
JERRY: No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
JERRY: No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
JERRY: No, nah, I'm not happy and I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
JERRY: No, never. ELAINE: Do you?
JERRY: No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would've said tonight.
JERRY: No, no I don't. Why?
JERRY: No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
JERRY: No, no no Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
JERRY: No, no of course not.
JERRY: No, no thank you.
JERRY: No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
JERRY: No, no the junior.
JERRY: No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised
JERRY: No, no tricks.
JERRY: No, no, 12-8!
JERRY: No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me! Jean-Paul: Man, he doesn't got in for you.
JERRY: No, no, I mean...
JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
JERRY: No, no, I...
JERRY: No, no, it was a small ceremony.
JERRY: No, no, no ugly side.
JERRY: No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
JERRY: No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
JERRY: No, no, no, it's... She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her. George: That's it. That's the line... ...that destroyed my life.
JERRY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
JERRY: No, No, No, No, Oh, No.
JERRY: No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
JERRY: No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
JERRY: No, no, no. Just hypothetically. Frankie: I gotta go to the park.
JERRY: No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing.
JERRY: No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
JERRY: No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
JERRY: No, no, the--
JERRY: No, no, there's no side!
JERRY: No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
JERRY: No, no, would you get up?
JERRY: No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if
JERRY: No, no.
JERRY: No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
JERRY: No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
JERRY: No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it's not like Marlene's a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we've
JERRY: No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-
JERRY: No, no. It's the valet guy.
JERRY: No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. WhatÂ’s important is you two getting back together. Eh, then weÂ’ll talk about the car.
JERRY: No, no.. I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted him change it to War and Peace!
JERRY: No, no... Still doin' the big sweep across.
JERRY: No, not a thing.
JERRY: No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
JERRY: No, not particularly.
JERRY: No, Nothing.
JERRY: No, of course not.
JERRY: No, out of the question.
JERRY: No, really, let's get another one. It will just take a second.
JERRY: No, really.. an airport run.
JERRY: No, road is a major detail!
JERRY: No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
JERRY: No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
JERRY: No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial. George: That's pretty pathetic.
JERRY: No, she's a little too cheery for me.
JERRY: No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun..
JERRY: No, she's not. Joey: Come on, Kramer! Kramer: Hey there. Joey: Come on. Mom's down in the car. Kramer: Okay, Joey.
JERRY: No, she's this woman who's booking me on these college tours. She thinks I'm some big celebrity that has to be pampered and explained every little thing.
JERRY: No, shower. So, where are we eating?
JERRY: No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that money.
JERRY: No, supermarket.
JERRY: No, thank you.
JERRY: No, thank you.
JERRY: No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
JERRY: No, that's great! That's terrific!
JERRY: No, that's Krama.
JERRY: No, that's midtown.
JERRY: No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
JERRY: No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
JERRY: No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman. George: Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
JERRY: No, there's less.
JERRY: No, Trini Lopez.
JERRY: No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
JERRY: No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
JERRY: No, we have time.
JERRY: No, we're having an intervention
JERRY: No, what'd you say?
JERRY: No, what?
JERRY: No, what? 'That's probably why..'
JERRY: No, what? What kind is it?
JERRY: No, yada yada is good. She's very succinct.
JERRY: No, you better get out of here. No, wait a second... Wait a second... I don't know the name of this woman in the
JERRY: No, you didn't.
JERRY: No, you don't have to buy anything.
JERRY: No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
JERRY: No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
JERRY: No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
JERRY: No, you idiot.
JERRY: No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
JERRY: No, you stay in the car.
JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!
JERRY: No, you walk out.
JERRY: No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
JERRY: No, you'd have to be crazy.
JERRY: No, you're not.
JERRY: No-o-o-o.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No. Dugan: So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria... J. Peterman: Oh, for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product is. Dugan: It's a, uh, washcloth. J. Peterman: No washcloths! Elaine: Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero. J. Peterman: Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist. Elaine: Are you okay, Mr. Peterman? J. Peterman: Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on. Elaine: Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero. Elaine: Mr. Peterman? George: I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
JERRY: No. EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
JERRY: No. George: I gotta hobble.
JERRY: No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
JERRY: No. I can't say as I have.
JERRY: No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
JERRY: No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
JERRY: No. I know what I want.
JERRY: No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
JERRY: No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
JERRY: No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
JERRY: No. I told you not to say anything.
JERRY: No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
JERRY: No. I'm not really looking.
JERRY: No. I'm waiting for...
JERRY: No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
JERRY: No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
JERRY: No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi--
JERRY: No. Never.
JERRY: No. No lunch.
JERRY: No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
JERRY: No. No thanks.
JERRY: No. No you're not.
JERRY: No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
JERRY: No. None.
JERRY: No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
JERRY: No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this
JERRY: No. So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
JERRY: No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
JERRY: No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
JERRY: No. We both just saw the same monkey.
JERRY: No. We gotta go to the soup place.
JERRY: No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1 900 dollars.
JERRY: No. Why? George: I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
JERRY: No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
JERRY: No. You're never here.
JERRY: No. You?
JERRY: No.. dry-cleaned.
JERRY: No...
JERRY: No... I find them repugnant and unappealing. Kramer bursts in
JERRY: No....
JERRY: No...Got dental appointment.
JERRY: Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
JERRY: Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
JERRY: Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. What the hell are you doing?
JERRY: Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
JERRY: Nobody you know...
JERRY: Nodding off...
JERRY: Noit your type?
JERRY: Non smoking would be great.
JERRY: Nooo.
JERRY: Not a good sign.
JERRY: Not a very long trip.
JERRY: Not as long.
JERRY: Not at all.
JERRY: Not bad!
JERRY: Not bad.
JERRY: Not comfortable... Jean-Paul: For God's sake...!
JERRY: Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
JERRY: Not even on the book jacket? Eva: There was no picture on the book jacket.
JERRY: Not even once?
JERRY: Not for another three days.
JERRY: Not for me, I love chatting. PATTY: Shh. Patty leans toward Jerry, as though to kiss him. Just as she's about to kiss, she breaks away. PATTY: No! No, I can't do this. I can't go through with it. Not even for him!
JERRY: Not from the footage I've seen.
JERRY: Not goin' to the Knick game.
JERRY: Not going to happen.
JERRY: Not good
JERRY: Not good.
JERRY: Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
JERRY: Not me.
JERRY: Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
JERRY: Not necessarily because..... Scene cuts back to Tim Whatley's dental office. Jerry is sitting in the
JERRY: Not now. She's right inside.
JERRY: Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
JERRY: Not once.
JERRY: Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
JERRY: Not our all the way, their all the way. I got the stink of responsibility on me. George: Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
JERRY: Not Pennypacker!
JERRY: Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
JERRY: Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer.
JERRY: Not that there's anything wrong with that...
JERRY: NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!
JERRY: Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
JERRY: Not the gown again .
JERRY: Not this movie.
JERRY: Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
JERRY: Not underpants.
JERRY: Not with a cane?
JERRY: Not yet. The other guy.
JERRY: Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
JERRY: Nothin'.....nothing at all.
JERRY: Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
JERRY: Nothing, nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
JERRY: Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
JERRY: Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
JERRY: Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
JERRY: Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -
JERRY: Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..
JERRY: Nothing...
JERRY: Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
JERRY: Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
JERRY: Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
JERRY: Now I should tell you at this point she's under the impression the you are a.....
JERRY: Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
JERRY: Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally , yeah this is Jerry ,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
JERRY: Now that's not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
JERRY: Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
JERRY: Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's Beaches for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
JERRY: Now what did you ask me again. Kramer is snoring.
JERRY: Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
JERRY: Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
JERRY: Now you're talkin' crazy!
JERRY: NOW!!!!.... Back to Jerry's place , evening.
JERRY: Now, all we gotta do is write it.
JERRY: Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
JERRY: Now, how could that be good?
JERRY: Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird Thing about it, is that people will touch other people's hair. You will
JERRY: Now, I'm not so sure.
JERRY: Now, itÂ’s time to go.
JERRY: Now, look at this. Cable's out.
JERRY: Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
JERRY: Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. I feel the swirl is a great
JERRY: Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
JERRY: Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way?
JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
JERRY: Number one?

JERRY: Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
JERRY: Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!
JERRY: Of course was the last thing he said?

JERRY: Of course, I always do.
JERRY: Of course, they're polyester.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass. George replacing his wallet in his pocket.
JERRY: Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
JERRY: Of course. It's garbage.
JERRY: Of course. We have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
JERRY: Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it.
JERRY: Of what? KRAMER: Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
JERRY: Oh

JERRY: Oh no.

JERRY: Oh you are beautiful!

JERRY: Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
JERRY: Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
JERRY: Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life.

JERRY: Oh, big fighting marlin.
JERRY: Oh, boy.
JERRY: Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.
JERRY: Oh, by marriage. We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
JERRY: Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
JERRY: Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!
JERRY: Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
JERRY: Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
JERRY: Oh, Carl can't wait a few more minutes?
JERRY: Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks
JERRY: Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: Oh, come on, be a come-with-guy.
JERRY: Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
JERRY: Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
JERRY: Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
JERRY: Oh, come on.
JERRY: Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
JERRY: Oh, come on. That's not true.
JERRY: Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
JERRY: Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
JERRY: Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.
JERRY: Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
JERRY: Oh, did he like it?
JERRY: Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
JERRY: Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me.
JERRY: Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
JERRY: Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
JERRY: Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
JERRY: Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
JERRY: Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes - to give, and give, and give..
JERRY: Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
JERRY: Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
JERRY: Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
JERRY: Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.

JERRY: Oh, he sang like a canary.
JERRY: Oh, he's having a heart attack.
JERRY: Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
JERRY: Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art.
JERRY: Oh, hello...
JERRY: Oh, here she comes.
JERRY: Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
JERRY: Oh, hi dad.
JERRY: Oh, hi Ellen.

JERRY: Oh, how come?
JERRY: Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
JERRY: Oh, I can take it. TOBY: Let's go.
JERRY: Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
JERRY: Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half my money!
JERRY: Oh, I can't-- I have a tendency to get chilly.
JERRY: Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
JERRY: Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
JERRY: oh, I d-I don't know. I d
JERRY: Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
JERRY: Oh, I don't believe this. Elaine: Jerry!
JERRY: Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her. George: What is that?
JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
JERRY: Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
JERRY: Oh, I got to see this thing.
JERRY: Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
JERRY: Oh, I had that comin' to me.
JERRY: Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves and wanted to get home and start working on his floor.
JERRY: Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
JERRY: Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want?
JERRY: Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
JERRY: Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
JERRY: Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
JERRY: Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.
JERRY: Oh, I was just looking for some... gum or... mint.
JERRY: Oh, I wouldn't quite say that.
JERRY: Oh, I'll split a cab with you. Walking down the street.
JERRY: Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
JERRY: Oh, I'm delighted.
JERRY: Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
JERRY: Oh, I'm gonna puke.
JERRY: Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
JERRY: Oh, I'm so sorry.
JERRY: Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin Artie Levine.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone...
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose. Kramer Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure you do. Christie begins to season her food, with salt. Jerry chews
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, Those aren't buoys. Father...
JERRY: Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
JERRY: Oh, I'm the doofus? Elaine: Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
JERRY: Oh, I, I, think I remember..
JERRY: Oh, in a minute, Carol.
JERRY: Oh, is this a bit?
JERRY: Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
JERRY: Oh, it doesn't matter now.
JERRY: Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
JERRY: Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex
JERRY: Oh, it won't be for that long.
JERRY: Oh, it's a scene man.
JERRY: Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.
JERRY: Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
JERRY: Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
JERRY: Oh, it's nothing...
JERRY: Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
JERRY: Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
JERRY: Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance calls I made to you why can't you.. . Why? Why do they just hang up like that?! Thank you very much.
JERRY: Oh, itÂ’s an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
JERRY: Oh, itÂ’s just this stupid thing.
JERRY: Oh, just trying to help me.. Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her
JERRY: Oh, Kramer, this is Donna. k Oh. Cotton Dockers!
JERRY: Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
JERRY: Oh, like you do.
JERRY: Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
JERRY: Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars. Jerry peers around the edge of the door, to see if the coast is clear.
JERRY: Oh, look, its so subjective.
JERRY: Oh, man!
JERRY: Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
JERRY: Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
JERRY: Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
JERRY: Oh, Martin!
JERRY: Oh, Mattingly just sinled .
JERRY: Oh, my god!
JERRY: Oh, my god!
JERRY: Oh, my God! Ma?

JERRY: Oh, no!
JERRY: Oh, no, no.
JERRY: Oh, no, not beautiful.
JERRY: Oh, no, not Frankie. Kramer: Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
JERRY: Oh, no, the woods! The hole! Kramer, seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck: Hey. Newman: Kramer, what the hell are you doing? Kramer: I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else. Newman: Not that! Kramer: What? Newman: You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen: you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift. Kramer: Are you through? Newman: No! And no one will ever see you again! Kramer: Are you through? Newman: Yes. No, wait! OK, yes. Newman, seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer: Quick! Get in! Kramer: Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down. Newman: There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now! Kramer: No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know! Newman: I know you know, but you don't know what I know. Kramer, being grabbed by the security officials: Hey!
JERRY: Oh, no.
JERRY: Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do? George: You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
JERRY: Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
JERRY: Oh, no. It is. Just be still.
JERRY: Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
JERRY: Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.
JERRY: Oh, no...
JERRY: Oh, no?
JERRY: Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.

JERRY: Oh, Okay I'm sorry, I didn't know what to bring, nobody told me.
JERRY: Oh, okay..
JERRY: Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
JERRY: Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
JERRY: Oh, Paul, could you hold that door... But Paul makes no move to hold the door, which shuts in Jerry's face.
JERRY: Oh, please...
JERRY: Oh, poor Blossom.
JERRY: Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
JERRY: Oh, really?

JERRY: Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.

JERRY: Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
JERRY: Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?

JERRY: Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
JERRY: Pennypacker.
JERRY: People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things - things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on. END OF SHOW.
JERRY: People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from the animals.
JERRY: People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
JERRY: People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
JERRY: Perfect.
JERRY: Peru ! I paid $300 bucks for these . I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks !
JERRY: Pez?
JERRY: Pff.
JERRY: Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
JERRY: Pinkish hue?
JERRY: Pinter?
JERRY: Plane's ready.
JERRY: Plantains?
JERRY: Played cards last night.
JERRY: Playing today?
JERRY: Please hurry. Look at you. Look at what you've become.
JERRY: Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
JERRY: Please, Donna.
JERRY: Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so
JERRY: Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my tattoos.
JERRY: Poor Beth.
JERRY: Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
JERRY: Poppie's
JERRY: Poppy seeds!
JERRY: Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
JERRY: Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
JERRY: Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
JERRY: Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
JERRY: Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life. Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and out of Jerry's apartment.
JERRY: Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they
JERRY: Pretty good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
JERRY: Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
JERRY: Pretty good.
JERRY: Pretty good.
JERRY: Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
JERRY: Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul. Jean-Paul: Man, I just want to get some sleep.
JERRY: Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
JERRY: Pride? George: No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
JERRY: Prior convictions? Leo?
JERRY: Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
JERRY: Probably the reason..
JERRY: Problem in the bedroom?
JERRY: Problem? George: The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
JERRY: Produce section. Very provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
JERRY: Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh.
JERRY: Prognosis negative!?
JERRY: Prognosis Negative.
JERRY: Projectionists.
JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?

JERRY: Quone? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to challenge that.
JERRY: Rabies.
JERRY: Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then I saw it in your house.

JERRY: Really? What a shock.
JERRY: Really? What happened?
JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?
JERRY: Really? When?
JERRY: Really? Why?
JERRY: Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! How yaÂ’ doing?
JERRY: Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
JERRY: Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his M.O.
JERRY: Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
JERRY: Remember David Puddy?
JERRY: Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.

JERRY: Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Right. For reducing the pond scum?
JERRY: Right. I am.
JERRY: Right. I forgot about choir.
JERRY: Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
JERRY: Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No
JERRY: Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case. George: That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...

JERRY: Same as you can't overwet. You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't overdie, you can't overdry.
JERRY: Sammy Davis had it. Kramer: So I listened to my katra and now I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion. Elaine: Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company. Kramer: Sure you have. Elaine: I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that. Kramer: You follow your katra, and you can do anything. Now get out of here.

JERRY: See? You give, and you get.
JERRY: Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.

JERRY: She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
JERRY: She does not.

JERRY: She faked.
JERRY: She flipped out! Just left.

JERRY: She might be. She's the star of the show.
JERRY: She must be psychotic or something.
JERRY: She reads lips.

JERRY: She said what?
JERRY: She saved your life?
JERRY: She says I suppress my emotions.

JERRY: She's a virgin, she just told me.
JERRY: She's also quite bold .
JERRY: She's an eskimo, actually.
JERRY: She's as good as anybody else.
JERRY: She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?

JERRY: Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all
JERRY: Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
JERRY: Tell me what?
JERRY: Tell you something...I do.
JERRY: tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
JERRY: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
JERRY: Thank you for your cooperation.
JERRY: Thank you very much, that's great- >clickclick click< Hello?
JERRY: Thank you very much.
JERRY: Thank you very much.
JERRY: Thank you very much. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
JERRY: Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
JERRY: Thank you! Goodnight!
JERRY: Thank you, Bryant.
JERRY: Thank you, no. George: ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. So... yeah. George: Boy, that was awkward!
JERRY: Thank you, Pamela!
JERRY: Thank you, thanks.
JERRY: Thank you.

JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: Thank you.

JERRY: Thank you. Nice job.
JERRY: Thank you. Taxi!
JERRY: Thank you... J+T: Mmmmmm!
JERRY: Thanks , thanks
JERRY: Thanks again.
JERRY: Thanks for the tip.
JERRY: Thanks, Julio.
JERRY: Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not a chicken.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Thanks. Jerry waits a while and realizes he has to go sit back with George and wait over there.]
JERRY: Thanks. Thanks for telling me.
JERRY: That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
JERRY: That close, huh?
JERRY: That doesn't make it right.
JERRY: That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
JERRY: That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
JERRY: That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this? On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, chanting Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
JERRY: That guy! Swarm! Swarm!
JERRY: That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
JERRY: That is close.
JERRY: That is disgusting.
JERRY: That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. ItÂ’s like a mink trap down there. What are you
JERRY: That is out there.
JERRY: That is so Franco.
JERRY: That is the guy! George: Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
JERRY: That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
JERRY: That is worse.
JERRY: That looks pretty good. Elaine: He's in.
JERRY: That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock? Jean-Paul: Flight to Cleveland?
JERRY: That orange dress is burned in my memory
JERRY: That smells good, what is that?
JERRY: That stinky old movie-house?
JERRY: That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.
JERRY: That wa sour Bobka. We had that Bobka!
JERRY: That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back.
JERRY: That was brutal. I can't go back out there.
JERRY: That was double overtime.
JERRY: That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over. As Jerry dials the girls number, George races to the bathroom one more time.
JERRY: That was Elaine...
JERRY: That was July 4th!
JERRY: That was our Bobka.
JERRY: That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
JERRY: That wasn't so bad, really...
JERRY: That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
JERRY: That woman is absolutely stunning.
JERRY: That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
JERRY: That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.
JERRY: That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.
JERRY: That'd be the fleas.
JERRY: That's a date .
JERRY: That's a date?
JERRY: That's a five.
JERRY: That's a good one. Dentists.
JERRY: That's a great place!
JERRY: That's a hell of a plan. Listen - KRAMER: What advice would you give young people?
JERRY: That's a lot of skin .
JERRY: That's a shame.
JERRY: That's a shame.
JERRY: That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
JERRY: That's alright, I got it.
JERRY: That's an interesting package.
JERRY: That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
JERRY: That's another loop hole . That's two dates without asking you out .
JERRY: That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
JERRY: That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
JERRY: That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. Ray?
JERRY: That's disgusting. Kramer: Well, it's my final offer. Puddy: You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman. Elaine: Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened. Puddy: Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman. Elaine: You're not taking me back? Puddy, leaving: That's right. Elaine: He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody... Kramer, handing out anti-mail pamphlets: Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend. Woman: Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head? Kramer: Because we're blind to their tyranny. Woman: Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket? Kramer: Yeah. Move along, Betty. Frankie: Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van? Kramer: Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia. Frankie: I'm, uh, I'm so stupid. Kramer: What? Frankie, running away: I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry. Kramer: Yeah, nice to meet you.
JERRY: That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it.
JERRY: That's enough!
JERRY: That's enough!
JERRY: That's enough. GEORGE: Early! Alright! Cold.
JERRY: That's from the car!
JERRY: That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
JERRY: That's good stuff.
JERRY: That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
JERRY: That's got nothin' to do with it.
JERRY: That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
JERRY: That's great.
JERRY: That's great. You know what? Leave it. Just pull the car around front.
JERRY: That's her! She's here!
JERRY: That's him. George: Is he still nuts?
JERRY: That's how it's gonna be.
JERRY: That's incredible!
JERRY: That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
JERRY: That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
JERRY: That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
JERRY: That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
JERRY: That's it, you gave up?
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks.
JERRY: That's my cockney accent.
JERRY: That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
JERRY: That's my walkman!
JERRY: That's neat.
JERRY: That's nice for the freaks.
JERRY: That's nice of you to say. The buzzer buzzes.
JERRY: That's nice!
JERRY: That's nice.
JERRY: That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. anyway what can I do I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
JERRY: That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
JERRY: That's not bad.
JERRY: That's not funny Naiomi. I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holacost is on.
JERRY: That's not going to be good for anybody.
JERRY: That's not necessary. You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.
JERRY: That's not that?
JERRY: That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
JERRY: That's not what I do.
JERRY: That's perfect. Could you excuse me one second. I'm sorry.
JERRY: That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
JERRY: That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
JERRY: That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
JERRY: That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
JERRY: That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
JERRY: That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? Last Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much.

JERRY: That's right. You're emotional.
JERRY: That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...
JERRY: That's so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
JERRY: That's strange...
JERRY: That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
JERRY: That's terrible...
JERRY: That's the bet! Hello? ..No, oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe I can still catch them. Ma!.. Ma!.. Up here! Don't get in the cab! .. Manya died! ..Manya died!!
JERRY: That's the bet! That you're not doing it!
JERRY: That's the garbage disposal!
JERRY: That's the guy?
JERRY: That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka.
JERRY: That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
JERRY: That's the least of what you've accomplished...
JERRY: That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
JERRY: That's the point.
JERRY: That's the rule.
JERRY: That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. Ping, what happened?
JERRY: That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
JERRY: That's the way it works.
JERRY: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life. Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
JERRY: That's tomato juice.
JERRY: That's true.
JERRY: That's true. Kramer giving Jerry his carryal.
JERRY: That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
JERRY: That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
JERRY: That's very nice, I guess.
JERRY: That's were they got it from!
JERRY: That's what I do with him
JERRY: That's what I thought.
JERRY: That's what it costs!
JERRY: That's what she told me!
JERRY: That's what they get!
JERRY: That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
JERRY: That's what's so fascinating.
JERRY: That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam. ELAINE: She's gonna ask how you got her number.
JERRY: That's your problem, you should be. Naked man drops half of his newspaper
JERRY: That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
JERRY: That.
JERRY: ThatÂ’s all there is to it.
JERRY: ThatÂ’s different. I didnÂ’t have feelings for those people. But you, youÂ’ll backslide
JERRY: ThatÂ’s not too bad. ItÂ’s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
JERRY: ThatÂ’s your big boy.
JERRY: The
JERRY: The amazing thing is you never have any place to go. Kramer leaves, George enters.
JERRY: The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a
JERRY: The apple pie you had today at Monks
JERRY: The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... The bad tipper!
JERRY: The bad fiancÂ‚, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
JERRY: The baldies
JERRY: The BB? He lives around here? MAN #1: That's his house right down the road.
JERRY: The beach?
JERRY: The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
JERRY: The big toe; The captain.
JERRY: The boom box incident?
JERRY: The botched it?
JERRY: The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.

JERRY: The Daily Worker has personal ads?
JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: I could use a cotton-ball right now...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: Let's move on... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know: Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?.
JERRY: The dog. You're getting the dog.
JERRY: The dog? New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up and there's a loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.
JERRY: The dog? The dog??
JERRY: The door? You left the door open?
JERRY: The driver seems a little put out .
JERRY: The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had nothing.
JERRY: The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
JERRY: The exact same outfit.
JERRY: The fabric of society is very complex George.

JERRY: The meeting you blew off?
JERRY: The murderers!
JERRY: The New York Yankees?!
JERRY: The New Yorker?
JERRY: The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.

JERRY: The poly?
JERRY: The pop-in.
JERRY: The Portuguese waitress?
JERRY: The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You're out
JERRY: The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour. I'm confused.
JERRY: The religious guy?

JERRY: Then he asked you out?
JERRY: Then it was trash.
JERRY: Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
JERRY: Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that? Both Jerry and Lisi are on the couch. Jerry has his head in his hands.
JERRY: Then we'll make it the eight.
JERRY: Then what do you call it? People donÂ’t just bump into each other and have sex. This isnÂ’t cinemax.
JERRY: Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
JERRY: Then what'd you come down here for?
JERRY: Then what?
JERRY: Then who?
JERRY: Then YOU would be hunched over.
JERRY: Then you're in a lot of trouble.
JERRY: Then, what was all that sniffing?
JERRY: there are no copies.
JERRY: There are ways.
JERRY: There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
JERRY: There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
JERRY: There isn't?
JERRY: There isn't?
JERRY: There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
JERRY: There must be some mistake.
JERRY: There really building a Utopian society up there huh .And you tribute all this to the calzone .
JERRY: There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
JERRY: There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.

JERRY: There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly
JERRY: There's really not that much to tell. About a month ago, we were here having lunch, when all of a sudden we both just blurted out... Jerry & Jeannie: I hate you! Jeannie: See ya.
JERRY: There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
JERRY: There's some hot air blowing in here..

JERRY: These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call!
JERRY: They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
JERRY: They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
JERRY: They could at least try it.
JERRY: They deliver the coal?

JERRY: They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.

JERRY: TheyÂ’re a comedy team.
JERRY: Thin ice, George. Thin ice..
JERRY: Things are good?
JERRY: think I've changed my mind.
JERRY: Think of me as a doctor.
JERRY: Think she wants those clubs.
JERRY: Think so?
JERRY: Thirteen thousand.
JERRY: This could be an emergency!
JERRY: This could only happen to you.
JERRY: This friendship.. it's not working.
JERRY: This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
JERRY: This is a nightmare.
JERRY: This is a person I like, it's not: How to score on spring break.
JERRY: This is a, Bob Cobb.
JERRY: This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
JERRY: This is amazing, you can't believe this!
JERRY: This is Amy.
JERRY: This is brutal...
JERRY: This is George, this is Kramer.
JERRY: This is George. I'm sorry...
JERRY: This is going to be a shame.
JERRY: This is GoldenBoy's son, BabyBlue.
JERRY: This is gonna be great!
JERRY: This is horrible! I care!
JERRY: This is how you operate?
JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
JERRY: This is it. I'm only going for the day. I just gotta drop by the drugstore and pick up a toothbrush.
JERRY: This is Jerry Seinfeld. Cuts to commercial. Back to Jerry's after an implied date with Alicia
JERRY: This is Laura.
JERRY: This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
JERRY: This is Lois.
JERRY: This is my friend George.
JERRY: This is Nikki .
JERRY: This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
JERRY: This is not a good time.
JERRY: This is outrageous! Pack of Juicy Fruit. MARCELINO: 85 cents.
JERRY: This is real believable.
JERRY: This is really too much.
JERRY: This is ridiculous.
JERRY: This is some FINE mutton.
JERRY: This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie! (Jerry get up to go find the letter. A second later, he returns, and starts
JERRY: This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
JERRY: This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?
JERRY: This is too much.
JERRY: This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
JERRY: This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
JERRY: This is what you gonna wear?
JERRY: This is your plan?
JERRY: This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
JERRY: This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. How much is it?
JERRY: This one?
JERRY: This thing has never worked right.
JERRY: This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for this course.
JERRY: This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
JERRY: This woman's completely ignoring me.
JERRY: This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
JERRY: This... thing... has got to be stopped!
JERRY: This?
JERRY: Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
JERRY: Those two?
JERRY: Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
JERRY: Three.
JERRY: Thus ends the great ball man experiment. Laura gets into the car service car.
JERRY: Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
JERRY: Tic-Tacs worked?
JERRY: Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
JERRY: Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane... Oops.
JERRY: Tina Turner?
JERRY: To a children's charity!
JERRY: To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
JERRY: to basically give this money away-
JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!
JERRY: To Latvian Orthodox?
JERRY: To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch. According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
JERRY: To my beautiful wife.
JERRY: To our future wives....yeah...
JERRY: To see a movie.
JERRY: To spite my parents?

JERRY: To wit
JERRY: Today is not cold.

JERRY: Todd. Oh yeah. He's a Kennedy.
JERRY: Told you .
JERRY: Tongue?
JERRY: Tonight.
JERRY: Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
JERRY: Too bad.
JERRY: Too bad.
JERRY: Too bad. It was erotic. Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment: Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
JERRY: Too good. MILOS: Another game for Milos!! Hahaha! Milos walks to the net to meet Jerry.
JERRY: Too late for that.
JERRY: Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
JERRY: Too thin?
JERRY: Transfer?
JERRY: Trip to Berlin?
JERRY: Tropic of Cancer.
JERRY: Tropic of Capricorn?

JERRY: Turn around, George.
JERRY: Turn in?
JERRY: Turn up the heat in your apartment!
JERRY: TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
JERRY: Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
JERRY: Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. [George looks at Elaine
JERRY: Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.
JERRY: Two Forty-Five.
JERRY: Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
JERRY: Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound! Kramer enters.
JERRY: Two minutes.
JERRY: Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes.. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
JERRY: Two o' clock.
JERRY: Two seconds. Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
JERRY: Two. Kramer: City or highway?
JERRY: Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
JERRY: Typical things.
JERRY: U-oh come on up. It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
JERRY: Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
JERRY: Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye

JERRY: Uh, again? I'll be right there. Jerry stomps his foot on the floor a few times before he leaves, he accidentally
JERRY: Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
JERRY: Uh, alright.
JERRY: Uh, bathroom.
JERRY: Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may

JERRY: Uh, Huh, yeah.
JERRY: Uh, I don't feel so good.
JERRY: Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.
JERRY: Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
JERRY: Uh, JFK. I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
JERRY: Uh, just my next door neighbor.
JERRY: Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. Haven't worn this one in a long time. MERYL: Ooh, cashmere?
JERRY: Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
JERRY: Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
JERRY: Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye.

JERRY: Uh, the four worst words in the English language.
JERRY: Uh, wa?
JERRY: Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
JERRY: uh, well I can't help you there .
JERRY: Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . .
JERRY: Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
JERRY: Uh, well. It, uh...
JERRY: Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. Now this is a good looking booth.
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. Alright, look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
JERRY: uh, yeah, the uuhh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all
JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?
JERRY: Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.

JERRY: Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
JERRY: Uh.. one of the three tenors.
JERRY: Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
JERRY: Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. WOMAN 1: That's right.
JERRY: Uh... may I help you?
JERRY: Uh...I got married. UNCLE LEO: You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
JERRY: Uh? Monks
JERRY: Uhhh.. GEORGE: ..does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or
JERRY: Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be solved.
JERRY: Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away.
JERRY: Um hum. George enters
JERRY: Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
JERRY: Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
JERRY: Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
JERRY: Um, huh, I don't have my watch on. It's being fixed.
JERRY: Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
JERRY: Um, um, Look to the cookie Elaine. Look to the cookie.

JERRY: Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
JERRY: Uncle Leo!
JERRY: Uncle Leo!
JERRY: Uncle Leo! Alright! Take it!
JERRY: Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
JERRY: Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and
JERRY: Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
JERRY: Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
JERRY: Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Uncle Leo. Hello!
JERRY: Uncle Leo?
JERRY: UNDATEABLE!
JERRY: Under arrest? What for?
JERRY: Under the sofa cushion.
JERRY: Understand you had a little talk with him too.
JERRY: Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
JERRY: Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
JERRY: Up state! Hummm.
JERRY: Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
JERRY: Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
JERRY: Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
JERRY: Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
JERRY: Vaya con dios. Kramer: Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
JERRY: Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
JERRY: Vermont! With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and

JERRY: Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
JERRY: Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
JERRY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
JERRY: Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
JERRY: Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?
JERRY: Wait a second!
JERRY: Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
JERRY: Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
JERRY: Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
JERRY: Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
JERRY: Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
JERRY: Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
JERRY: Wait a second, whatÂ’s going on here?
JERRY: Wait a second. .Just give me a second
JERRY: Wait a second. Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in ElaineÂ’s purse.
JERRY: Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
JERRY: Wait a second. My move?
JERRY: Wait a second. This'll scare 'em off. Well, good night, Ollie.
JERRY: Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them. We read from TROPIC OF CAPRICORN. I was all set to return TROPIC OF CANCER. And then ...
JERRY: Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
JERRY: Wait a second... That's her... on the right.
JERRY: Wait a second... wait a second!! The letter, that's the letter!
JERRY: Wait'll you get to know him.
JERRY: Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that.
JERRY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
JERRY: Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
JERRY: Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
JERRY: Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
JERRY: Wait. How does Horneck know you?
JERRY: Wait. I'll go with you. Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!
JERRY: Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says Waiting room. There's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting room, they're going to use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You pretend you're
JERRY: Walk away?
JERRY: Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
JERRY: Was he out there?
JERRY: Was I supposed to bring something?
JERRY: Was it apple?
JERRY: Was it eaten?
JERRY: Was it in the trash?
JERRY: Was it pimple popper MD?
JERRY: Wasn't that kind of important?
JERRY: Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
JERRY: We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
JERRY: We are dead.
JERRY: We can only thank God for that.
JERRY: We can talk.
JERRY: We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Man's Bundle. Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. What kind of perfume is that you're wearing?
JERRY: We come from the same place.
JERRY: We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
JERRY: We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
JERRY: We could go to one of those cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
JERRY: We could visit together!
JERRY: We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
JERRY: We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
JERRY: We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can't stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. No is he going to a
JERRY: We donÂ’t have two seconds?
JERRY: We gotta confess.
JERRY: We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
JERRY: WE HAD A PACT!!! Closing credits
JERRY: We had quite a little chat.
JERRY: We have time.
JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.

JERRY: we make all these plans - he goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
JERRY: We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
JERRY: We should have had that Bobka.
JERRY: We used to come in every day.
JERRY: We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
JERRY: We went over that.
JERRY: We were right on the border. Cut back to the street corner. Kramer: Maybe he's with the company. Elaine: What? Kramer: The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within. Elaine: What about his comedy act? Kramer: That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people. Elaine: What about George? Kramer: What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy! Elaine: I'll bet they were even in on it. Kramer: Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. I'm not gonna. Elaine: Kramer, you're hurting me! Quick cut to the now approaching limo. George: Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over. Elaine: Get off of me!! The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out. Kramer: O'Brien. This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby bus stop. Man: O'Brien? Is that him? Man #2: Yeah, that's him. Man #3: Look there's O'Brien! Man #4: Filthy nazi bastard! All four: Let's get him!! They begin running full speed towards the gang. George: What do I do?! What do I do?!
JERRY: We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
JERRY: We were ten. Frankie: Come on. Let's take it for a spin.
JERRY: We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing.
JERRY: We won't ruin the friendship.
JERRY: We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment of my life.
JERRY: We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..
JERRY: We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.

JERRY: We're going to the Knick game! George: Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
JERRY: We're going. That's next Wednesday.
JERRY: We're gonna have to talk about this later.
JERRY: We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
JERRY: We're having the intervention for Richie.
JERRY: We're just not suited to be friends.
JERRY: We're lucky they are even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!
JERRY: We're not leaving the car!
JERRY: We're pathetic
JERRY: We're still friends.
JERRY: We're straightening out!
JERRY: We're talkin' federal crime here.
JERRY: We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
JERRY: We're? What do you mean, We're?
JERRY: We've been breaking up for 10 hours?

JERRY: We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
JERRY: We? No.
JERRY: We? No. Club announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania.
JERRY: Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet an social challenge.
JERRY: Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?
JERRY: Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.
JERRY: Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
JERRY: Welcome back to the show. Kramer walks back in, clean shaven.
JERRY: Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
JERRY: Well , I got to talk her out of this. Kramer; I thought you said she stinks
JERRY: Well , now I'm engaged..
JERRY: Well , where is it?.
JERRY: Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
JERRY: Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
JERRY: Well Cindy, the place looks great. She grabs her money off the counter.
JERRY: Well do you feel anything?
JERRY: Well don't get too comfortable, as soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
JERRY: Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
JERRY: Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
JERRY: Well George is an idiot.
JERRY: Well good night.
JERRY: Well he doesn't even want himself there.
JERRY: Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
JERRY: Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
JERRY: Well he's kind of modest.
JERRY: Well Hello..
JERRY: Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
JERRY: Well how are you going .....
JERRY: Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
JERRY: Well I can see it.
JERRY: Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
JERRY: Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago .
JERRY: Well I do.
JERRY: Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
JERRY: Well I don't want to take too much off.
JERRY: Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
JERRY: Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
JERRY: Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
JERRY: Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
JERRY: Well I started to go under...
JERRY: Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
JERRY: Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
JERRY: Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
JERRY: Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
JERRY: Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, Gone.
JERRY: Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
JERRY: Well I'll get them.
JERRY: Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
JERRY: Well I'm not dating any other deaf women. Kramer enters.
JERRY: Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do. They are sitting on the couch again. Jerry nods at everything Lisi mumbles.
JERRY: Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
JERRY: Well I, if it's your day off I really...
JERRY: Well I...
JERRY: Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite?
JERRY: Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
JERRY: Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody? George: Like who?
JERRY: Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
JERRY: Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
JERRY: Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
JERRY: Well it's probably just easier to say water cooler show than coffee machine show.
JERRY: Well it's very emasculating.. Jessie looks befuddled and leaves.
JERRY: Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
JERRY: Well Lisi, that was another-
JERRY: Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
JERRY: Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
JERRY: Well maybe they were here from before.
JERRY: Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars. Man #2: Those collars are funny!
JERRY: Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
JERRY: Well put something down, you're taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac, and Artie, they're all coming over here before the
JERRY: Well six and sex are close.
JERRY: Well that's a start.
JERRY: Well that's all I got.
JERRY: Well the crowd most have gone wild!
JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
JERRY: Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
JERRY: Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
JERRY: Well this is it.
JERRY: Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
JERRY: Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
JERRY: Well this is very awkward.
JERRY: Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
JERRY: Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
JERRY: Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that.
JERRY: Well turn the light on...
JERRY: Well we
JERRY: Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do? George: I don't know.
JERRY: Well we saw you come in.
JERRY: Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
JERRY: Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. What brings you here?
JERRY: Well wh..wh.what are you doing?
JERRY: Well what about me?
JERRY: Well what am I going to tell Alex?
JERRY: Well what am I supposed to do now?
JERRY: Well what could I do ? Unless you pay him a visit .
JERRY: Well what do girls do ?
JERRY: Well what do you suggest?
JERRY: Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
JERRY: Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
JERRY: Well what does this mean?
JERRY: Well what happened?
JERRY: Well what is it?
JERRY: Well what'd you mean?
JERRY: Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!
JERRY: Well why don't you say it?
JERRY: Well women do it.
JERRY: Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
JERRY: Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing.
JERRY: Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
JERRY: Well you have insurance...
JERRY: Well you have to.
JERRY: Well you know what this means, don't you?
JERRY: Well you might as well look it over. Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner. Kramer: So what's going on, how did all this happen? Elaine: Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game. Kramer: Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up. Elaine: He did. Kramer: Well then why would they take a limo from the airport? Elaine: I don't know. Kramer: That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else? Elaine: Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy. Kramer: O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien? Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech. George: ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
JERRY: Well you said they could come and take the records.
JERRY: Well you should tell her.
JERRY: Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was
JERRY: Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
JERRY: Well you're not Louis Lane.
JERRY: Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
JERRY: Well you've really built yourself up into something.
JERRY: Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
JERRY: Well, a law's a law.
JERRY: Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
JERRY: Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
JERRY: Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
JERRY: Well, after he bit my friend--
JERRY: Well, ah.. What? Kind of like this?
JERRY: Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
JERRY: Well, at least have some reaction to it. Elaine:
JERRY: Well, at least he didn't-
JERRY: Well, at least taste it.
JERRY: Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
JERRY: Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
JERRY: Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
JERRY: Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
JERRY: Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
JERRY: Well, break a leg tonight.
JERRY: Well, break a leg.
JERRY: Well, Clyde might not tell him.
JERRY: Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
JERRY: Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
JERRY: Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
JERRY: Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
JERRY: Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
JERRY: Well, either you see him or you don't.
JERRY: Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday..
JERRY: Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
JERRY: Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... ha ha  Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the
JERRY: Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
JERRY: Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
JERRY: Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
JERRY: Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
JERRY: Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
JERRY: Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
JERRY: Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
JERRY: Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
JERRY: Well, Guatamala.
JERRY: Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
JERRY: Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
JERRY: Well, he can't kill me, right?
JERRY: Well, he was wrong.
JERRY: Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
JERRY: Well, her belly button is like a mouth. IÂ’m bored. Talk to me.
JERRY: Well, here we are.
JERRY: Well, here we are...
JERRY: Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big
JERRY: Well, how come?
JERRY: Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
JERRY: Well, how much are you going to invest?
JERRY: Well, I . . .
JERRY: Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
JERRY: Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
JERRY: Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
JERRY: Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... Mulva!
JERRY: Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
JERRY: Well, I can't wear it.
JERRY: Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
JERRY: Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
JERRY: Well, I did the best I could.
JERRY: Well, I didn't sleep with her. GEORGE: Because of society, right?
JERRY: Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
JERRY: Well, I don't normally--
JERRY: Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
JERRY: Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
JERRY: Well, I donÂ’t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
JERRY: Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
JERRY: Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
JERRY: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
JERRY: Well, I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
JERRY: Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
JERRY: Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
JERRY: Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
JERRY: Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
JERRY: Well, I guess we'll be going..
JERRY: Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
JERRY: Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
JERRY: Well, I have this neighbor...
JERRY: Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
JERRY: Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
JERRY: Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
JERRY: Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
JERRY: Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
JERRY: Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, it's a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of it. It keeps coming in and coming in. Everytime I
JERRY: Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
JERRY: Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
JERRY: Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
JERRY: Well, I think you're wrong.
JERRY: Well, I told my wife not to bring it.
JERRY: Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
JERRY: Well, I want those keys.
JERRY: Well, I want to sit down.
JERRY: Well, I was here, thatÂ’s everyone .
JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
JERRY: Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
JERRY: Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
JERRY: Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too. Jerry and Elaine sit in a booth.
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
JERRY: Well, I'll think about it...
JERRY: Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
JERRY: Well, I'm calling this off right now.
JERRY: Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
JERRY: Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting
JERRY: Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
JERRY: Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
JERRY: Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
JERRY: Well, I'm great.
JERRY: Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
JERRY: Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
JERRY: Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
JERRY: Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
JERRY: Well, I'm not.
JERRY: Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
JERRY: Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me! Jerry opens the door.
JERRY: Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
JERRY: Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?
JERRY: Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.
JERRY: Well, I've been looking forward to it.
JERRY: Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get
JERRY: Well, I..
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
JERRY: Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
JERRY: Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
JERRY: Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
JERRY: Well, if that's not that, what is that?
JERRY: Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
JERRY: Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
JERRY: Well, is Elaine here?
JERRY: Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
JERRY: Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
JERRY: Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
JERRY: Well, it has nothing to do with you.
JERRY: Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes. George: Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the
JERRY: Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
JERRY: Well, it was sudden.
JERRY: Well, it was that woman across the street. You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next.
JERRY: Well, it was the best of those movies. George: KHAN! Wyck: George. Wyck: George. George: Oh! Wyck: I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation. George: Wink. Wyck: Wyck. George: Wyck. Wyck: Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies. George: Oh. I know they have some monies. Wyck: They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding. George: So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we-- Wyck: Yes. George: And now? Wyck: Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse. George: This townhouse? Wyck: This would have been your wedding gift. George: And now? Wyck: Not. George: Not. Wyck: Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy. George: You know, it really can't. Mulva: So who broke it off?
JERRY: Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
JERRY: Well, it's a first visit.
JERRY: Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
JERRY: Well, it's a spider.
JERRY: Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno...
JERRY: Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
JERRY: Well, it's been a great visit.
JERRY: Well, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? It's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger.
JERRY: Well, it's honest.
JERRY: Well, it's kinda silly, but.. (Scene cuts to Elaine on the sidewalk waiting for JFK Jr. She checks her watch. Scene cuts back to Jerry's apartment. Marla, obviously upset, is putting her coat
JERRY: Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
JERRY: Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
JERRY: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
JERRY: Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
JERRY: Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
JERRY: Well, just
JERRY: Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
JERRY: Well, just get it down.
JERRY: Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything.
JERRY: Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
JERRY: Well, keep looking. New scene.
JERRY: Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
JERRY: Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
JERRY: Well, let's confront 'em.
JERRY: Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
JERRY: Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.
JERRY: Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. [hands Elaine the work
JERRY: Well, maybe he doesn't have a get outta here kind of personality.
JERRY: Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
JERRY: Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
JERRY: Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
JERRY: Well, maybe it's a good thing.
JERRY: Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
JERRY: Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
JERRY: Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
JERRY: Well, maybe she was disconnected.
JERRY: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions about hunting and testicles...
JERRY: Well, maybe your refrigerator...
JERRY: Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
JERRY: Well, no, I'm not one of those.
JERRY: Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.
JERRY: Well, nobody sees the... cover. Kramer: God!
JERRY: Well, not everything. I do what I can.
JERRY: Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
JERRY: Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
JERRY: Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
JERRY: Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is the levels.
JERRY: Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely
JERRY: Well, once I didnÂ’t have dinner until, like 9:00 oÂ’clock, that was pretty rough. Hey, do me a favour will yaÂ’? Throw out my garbage for me.
JERRY: Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
JERRY: Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
JERRY: Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
JERRY: Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
JERRY: Well, Rabbi, well.
JERRY: Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
JERRY: Well, she could come.
JERRY: Well, she framed it and everything.
JERRY: Well, she'll still be an ex-con.
JERRY: Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
JERRY: Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
JERRY: Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
JERRY: Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
JERRY: Well, so that's that.
JERRY: Well, so what if I said that?
JERRY: Well, so what should we do?
JERRY: Well, so what's the difference?
JERRY: Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
JERRY: Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
JERRY: Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
JERRY: Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
JERRY: Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will always trade sleep for sex.
JERRY: Well, thank you very much.
JERRY: Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath! On my block, a lot of people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
JERRY: Well, thank you, Marcelino.
JERRY: Well, thanks anyway.
JERRY: Well, that all depends. . .
JERRY: Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
JERRY: Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.
JERRY: Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic, sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
JERRY: Well, that's garbage.
JERRY: Well, that's good. Well, the drive home should be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don't care. That' the manager? Do you wnat me to see if we can get another room?
JERRY: Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
JERRY: Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want to think about this. I'm selling.
JERRY: Well, that's one hell of a gig. Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
JERRY: Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
JERRY: Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual. Mulva: Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.
JERRY: Well, that's very interesting. Just then, uncle Leo strolls up the path to the nursing home. Jerry
JERRY: Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
JERRY: Well, that's where it gets tricky.
JERRY: Well, that's your ceiling.
JERRY: Well, thatÂ’s it. You two are back together.
JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
JERRY: Well, the game's starting just about now.
JERRY: Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he's doing.
JERRY: Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of
JERRY: Well, then I'm not going to the game either. Okay? I'll give him both tickets.
JERRY: Well, then what're you doing?
JERRY: Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
JERRY: Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
JERRY: Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
JERRY: Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
JERRY: Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
JERRY: Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers. Elaine, entering Jerry's apartment: Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love. George: That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers. Elaine: Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
JERRY: Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.
JERRY: Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
JERRY: Well, they might hook us up again.
JERRY: Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
JERRY: Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
JERRY: Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
JERRY: Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
JERRY: Well, theyÂ’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
JERRY: Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
JERRY: Well, this is all very sophisticated. INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
JERRY: Well, this is great.
JERRY: Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. George:, I am really gonna make some changes.
JERRY: Well, this is it. I'm selling.

JERRY: Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. 4But she scooped them.

JERRY: Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does.

She takes hold of one of the plugs and yanks it out of the socket with a grunt. The grunt wakes Kramer, who looks groggily around and sees Elaine standing holding the plug, as if she's just unplugged his life support. He stares, bug-eyed and shrieks in terror. KRAMER: Waahhh!!! A plane landing, with the caption 'NEW YORK, NEW YORK'. Once again, George drives along, frustrated and angry. GEORGE: 'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and... He tails off, as he can't think of anywhere to go. Then a look of enlightenment comes to George's face, as he thinks of something. GEORGE: Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! D'ohh! George looks gutted for a second, then a determined expression comes to his face. He swings the car round with a squeal of tires, and heads back towards the airport. GEORGE: Huh haha! You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! Ha ha!
JERRY: What happened to you, pal?
JERRY: What happened to you? Kramer: Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. What is that?

JERRY: Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
JERRY: Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
JERRY: Yeah, all right. All right.
JERRY: Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
JERRY: Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks! Cut back to Elaine at Mr. Pitt's. There are pairs of socks everywhere. Pitt has on the latest pair.
JERRY: yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
JERRY: Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
JERRY: Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
JERRY: Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...
JERRY: Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
JERRY: Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
JERRY: Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
JERRY: Yeah, and, because of the.. time.
JERRY: Yeah, and?
JERRY: Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
JERRY: Yeah, big surprise.
JERRY: Yeah, but how am I...
JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
JERRY: Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
JERRY: Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
JERRY: Yeah, but it never worked.
JERRY: Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
JERRY: Yeah, but John invited her.
JERRY: Yeah, but now I'm nervous.
JERRY: Yeah, but now you're in here all the time.
JERRY: Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
JERRY: Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
JERRY: Yeah, but why would you...
JERRY: Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
JERRY: Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
JERRY: Yeah, but...
JERRY: Yeah, but?
JERRY: Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
JERRY: Yeah, come on. What's with you?
JERRY: Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
JERRY: Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an accident.
JERRY: Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
JERRY: Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
JERRY: Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
JERRY: Yeah, go ahead, take it.
JERRY: Yeah, good idea.
JERRY: Yeah, good morning.
JERRY: Yeah, got it from the bank.
JERRY: Yeah, he just walked by.
JERRY: Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!
JERRY: Yeah, he seems pretty happy. Elaine: Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
JERRY: Yeah, he was nice.
JERRY: Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
JERRY: Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
JERRY: Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. I know, I know. It's down again.
JERRY: Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get
JERRY: Yeah, here.
JERRY: Yeah, how about a mute?
JERRY: Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance.
JERRY: Yeah, I did that too.
JERRY: Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
JERRY: Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
JERRY: Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching
JERRY: Yeah, I heard.
JERRY: Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
JERRY: Yeah, I know that!
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
JERRY: Yeah, I know...
JERRY: Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
JERRY: Yeah, I liked him.
JERRY: Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, IÂ’ll see ya.
JERRY: Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
JERRY: Yeah, I started out real classy...
JERRY: Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
JERRY: Yeah, I think it is. Where's Elaine?
JERRY: Yeah, I think you would.
JERRY: Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again. Kramer & George: No. No
JERRY: Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
JERRY: Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...
JERRY: Yeah, I washed it.
JERRY: Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
JERRY: Yeah, I'll have the egg salad on whole wheat.
JERRY: Yeah, I'll see ya'. Elaine: . . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
JERRY: Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal Wild, Wild,
JERRY: Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure you'll live. They board the plane, and the flight attendant welcomes Elaine aboard.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure...
JERRY: Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm wanting to get married real soon...
JERRY: Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.
JERRY: Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
JERRY: Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
JERRY: Yeah, isn't that something? Elaine enters.
JERRY: Yeah, it is.
JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
JERRY: Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
JERRY: Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
JERRY: Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
JERRY: Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
JERRY: Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today.
JERRY: Yeah, it's my life's work.
JERRY: Yeah, it's no big deal.
JERRY: Yeah, it's pretty good.
JERRY: Yeah, itÂ’s some place down in the village.
JERRY: Yeah, Koko.
JERRY: Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
JERRY: Yeah, let's just get out of here. Hole Digger #2, eyeing the empty hole, and getting into it: Are you done with that? Frank, coming upon the van, supposedly left by Kramer for him, in the woods: Good. He left the door unlocked. Estelle: Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods? Frank: Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here. Estelle, looking inside of the van: Wow! Frank, reclining the seats in the van to a bed: Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama! Postmaster General: Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here? Kramer: Huh? Who are you? Postmaster General: Well, you can just call me Henry. Kramer: Henry Atkins? The postmaster general? Postmaster General: Last time I checked. Kramer: Henry... can I get out of here now? Postmaster General: Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you. Kramer: Oh? Postmaster General: I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer? Kramer: Yeah. Postmaster General: Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you: you make a pretty strong case. I mean, just imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs, door to door. Kramer: Yeah! Ha ha. Postmaster General: Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf. Kramer: I'm very, very sorry. Postmaster General: Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer? Kramer: Sure do! Postmaster General, receiving a salute from Kramer: Now, that's better. Kramer, seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man: Geez. Newman? Newman, whimpering: Tell the world my story.
JERRY: Yeah, Levine. And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp... Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean,
JERRY: Yeah, like a farm boy.
JERRY: Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe we have. - COMMERCIAL BREAK -
JERRY: Yeah, maybe.
JERRY: Yeah, me neither.
JERRY: Yeah, me too.
JERRY: Yeah, me too.
JERRY: Yeah, me too.
JERRY: Yeah, me too... He seems so sincere. Tia walks by, along with an entourage of photographers.
JERRY: Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do? Elaine: Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity. Jerry, turning on the commercial: Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this? On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, chanting Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz! Elaine: Oh, no.
JERRY: Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
JERRY: Yeah, one sec.
JERRY: Yeah, only for a while.
JERRY: Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
JERRY: Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
JERRY: Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
JERRY: Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
JERRY: Yeah, see you.
JERRY: Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
JERRY: Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna
JERRY: Yeah, she's got a big nose.
JERRY: Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
JERRY: Yeah, smoke.
JERRY: Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way. George: All the way?
JERRY: Yeah, so do you.
JERRY: Yeah, so how's my money?
JERRY: Yeah, so she and Triangle Boy can go out to fancy restaurants.
JERRY: Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry again.
JERRY: Yeah, so.
JERRY: Yeah, so?
JERRY: Yeah, so?
JERRY: Yeah, sounds like fun.
JERRY: Yeah, sure we will.
JERRY: Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
JERRY: Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
JERRY: Yeah, take it easy.
JERRY: Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
JERRY: Yeah, thanks.
JERRY: Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
JERRY: Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
JERRY: Yeah, that was me.
JERRY: Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
JERRY: Yeah, that'd be something.
JERRY: Yeah, that's a point...
JERRY: Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
JERRY: Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.
JERRY: Yeah, that's normal. Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
JERRY: Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest. ELAINE: Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right!
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: Yeah, that's true...
JERRY: Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Elaine: Kramer! Kramer: Oh, hey. Elaine: What are you doing? Kramer: Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating. Elaine: You never said you were fighting children. Kramer: Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity. Elaine: This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff? Kramer: No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock. Elaine: Search... for Spock?! Kramer: Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always... Elaine: You doofus!
JERRY: Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
JERRY: Yeah, the guy with the flat head?
JERRY: Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
JERRY: Yeah, the other guy.
JERRY: Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
JERRY: Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
JERRY: Yeah, they're great. Mr. Pitt: What about appetite suppressants?
JERRY: Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
JERRY: Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
JERRY: Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and
JERRY: Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.
JERRY: Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
JERRY: Yeah, tomorrow.
JERRY: Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
JERRY: Yeah, too bad.
JERRY: Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.
JERRY: Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where do you live, uh up town? Upper west side?
JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it...
JERRY: Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. Uhm, it's for you.
JERRY: Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
JERRY: Yeah, we should.
JERRY: Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
JERRY: Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.
JERRY: Yeah, well you're going.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I didn't.. Is that something you want to borrow?
JERRY: Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
JERRY: Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
JERRY: Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
JERRY: Yeah, well, until this bill is paid... Jerry takes back the tab, then takes the cereal out of Kramer's hands.
JERRY: Yeah, well, won't be long.
JERRY: Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.
JERRY: Yeah, what else?
JERRY: Yeah, what's it like?
JERRY: Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
JERRY: Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
JERRY: Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. What do you mean you can't tell me?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, take care.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back. I'm not happy with what I wrote.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.
JERRY: yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's late.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. I don't care about that.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah...
JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
JERRY: Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
JERRY: Yeah, you in? Kramer: No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class. George: George is going to the movies!
JERRY: Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
JERRY: Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
JERRY: Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton.
JERRY: Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
JERRY: Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid! New scene - George and Robin in a booth at the coffee shop. Robin's kid is under the table.
JERRY: Yeah, you told me.
JERRY: Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
JERRY: Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
JERRY: Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
JERRY: Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. When are you getting out of there? George: Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here? Wyck: Oh, no, not even close. George: I can't go.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers. Elaine and Mr. Lippman at Monk's.
JERRY: Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! What are you doing with that?
JERRY: Yeah. And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
JERRY: Yeah. And she picked the day!
JERRY: Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
JERRY: Yeah. Are you full?
JERRY: Yeah. Come on up.
JERRY: Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because
JERRY: Yeah. GEORGE: So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?
JERRY: Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
JERRY: Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
JERRY: Yeah. I hope so ?!
JERRY: Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here , and the part obsessed with sex. Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence.
JERRY: Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it.
JERRY: yeah. I think I do.
JERRY: Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
JERRY: Yeah. I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
JERRY: Yeah. I'll take care of it. Just throw that in there, would you? Mr. Pitt: Excuse me. I take heart medication. What would you recommend for a runny nose?
JERRY: Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
JERRY: Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
JERRY: Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
JERRY: Yeah. It's in your closet.
JERRY: Yeah. Kramer made it.
JERRY: Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
JERRY: Yeah. Look at the time.
JERRY: Yeah. Me.
JERRY: Yeah. Nine oÂ’clock.
JERRY: Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
JERRY: Yeah. Proctologist.
JERRY: Yeah. Ralph sniffs and rubs his eyes.
JERRY: Yeah. Really. Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
JERRY: Yeah. She would love cashmere.
JERRY: Yeah. So you really like this guy.
JERRY: Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
JERRY: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
JERRY: Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
JERRY: Yeah. The maid leaves Jerry's apartment. Elaine smiles at Jerry.
JERRY: Yeah. There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
JERRY: Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
JERRY: Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
JERRY: Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you
JERRY: Yeah. Was that a beauty or what? George: What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
JERRY: Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
JERRY: Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I
JERRY: Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
JERRY: Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
JERRY: Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
JERRY: Yeah. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
JERRY: Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
JERRY: Yeah. What does that mean?
JERRY: Yeah. What's wrong, why?
JERRY: Yeah. Where's George? Hmmm... We go to a shot outside the plane looking in on a rather roughed up George Costanza. He screams:
JERRY: Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally- George rips off his glasses.
JERRY: Yeah. Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
JERRY: Yeah. Yes, she is.
JERRY: Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
JERRY: Yeah.,
JERRY: Yeah..
JERRY: Yeah..
JERRY: Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.
JERRY: Yeah.. how about this: I say How's it goin'?
JERRY: Yeah.. How ya doing?
JERRY: Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
JERRY: Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
JERRY: Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
JERRY: Yeah.. yeah.
JERRY: Yeah...
JERRY: Yeah... George: Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
JERRY: Yeah... So's shock therapy.
JERRY: Yeah... Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem .

JERRY: Yes you do.
JERRY: Yes you do. That's what you both think.
JERRY: Yes you would. Kramer enters
JERRY: Yes!
JERRY: Yes!
JERRY: Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's
JERRY: Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
JERRY: Yes!!!
JERRY: Yes, a purse. I carry a purse! Jerry, on the phone with Elaine putting his things back into his wallet
JERRY: Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
JERRY: Yes, all right, Katie.
JERRY: Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
JERRY: Yes, but let's just stop it right there.
JERRY: Yes, but--
JERRY: Yes, bye.
JERRY: Yes, change. By all means, change. Christie walks away down a hallway. Jerry removes his coat and sits
JERRY: Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
JERRY: Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores. Dolores: Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya.
JERRY: Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out? Jerry is getting some sort of candy bar out of a packet on the counter. GEORGE: Reilly is no longer with the club. You believe that? George wanders over into the kitchen.
JERRY: Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
JERRY: Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
JERRY: Yes, I do.
JERRY: Yes, I followed the planes.
JERRY: Yes, I heard you.
JERRY: Yes, I know, I know.
JERRY: Yes, I know. I've flown before.
JERRY: Yes, I pick it up.
JERRY: Yes, I poo-poo.

JERRY: Yes, I'm fine.
JERRY: Yes, I'm impugning a continent.

JERRY: You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
JERRY: You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
JERRY: You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
JERRY: You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
JERRY: You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
JERRY: You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.

JERRY: You know what's good for that? Relish. Phone rings, Jerry answers.
JERRY: You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number... New scene - Elaine at Mr. Pitt's. He's trying on the socks she's brought him.

JERRY: You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really - interesting.. he would-
JERRY: You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
JERRY: You know, I really.. I've come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in you life that they're just always your friends and you have to accept it. You see them, you don't really want to see them. You don't call them. They call you. You don't call back. They call again. The only way to get through talking with people
JERRY: You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
JERRY: You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
JERRY: You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call

JERRY: You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
JERRY: You know, I've never seen you drive.
JERRY: You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
JERRY: You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.

JERRY: You know, it seems impossible.
JERRY: you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
JERRY: You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
JERRY: You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
JERRY: You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.

JERRY: You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
JERRY: You know, the Maestro.

JERRY: You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something. Joe Mayo, coming up to George and Jerry.
JERRY: You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building.. and she loves a good shower.
JERRY: You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
JERRY: You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
JERRY: You know, this is your coat.

JERRY: You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
JERRY: You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
JERRY: You know, why we're here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. Did you ring?, I can't find him. Where did he go? He didn't tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go: We gotta be getting back. Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.

JERRY: You know, you're little hair hat there.
JERRY: You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.

JERRY: You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
JERRY: You need an exterminator?
JERRY: You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
JERRY: You never know.
JERRY: You never really had the right comeback, anyway. George jerks out of the fridge, slamming the door. GEORGE: Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say. George walks back into the living room and picks up a newspaper. The door opens and Kramer enters. KRAMER: Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end. GEORGE: Ohh, I wanted to see that. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

JERRY: You see that's not fair. We were here ahead of all these people.
JERRY: You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.

JERRY: You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
JERRY: You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...

Peterman: What about you? Elaine: Me? Why me? J. Peterman: Why, indeed. Elaine: Mr. Peterman, you can't leave. J. Peterman: I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma. Elaine: Burma? J.

JERRY: You went all night? KRAMER: Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?
JERRY: You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head. WOMAN 2: No, I'm not a psycho.
JERRY: You were livin' in the village then, right?
JERRY: You were watchin'? Where?
JERRY: You weren't supposed to say that.
JERRY: You werenÂ’t?
JERRY: You what?
JERRY: You what? You passed? How could you do that?
JERRY: You what?! Get out! Ten thousand?
JERRY: You what??
JERRY: You won't even taste it?
JERRY: You won't.
JERRY: You would still wanna move in here?
JERRY: You would turn me in?
JERRY: You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
JERRY: You'd have marched on Great Neck?
JERRY: You'll be naked of course.
JERRY: You'll be out before we get the check.
JERRY: You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
JERRY: You'll never say that to her face.
JERRY: You'll see. Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'

JERRY: You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman? NEWMAN: Who?
JERRY: You're breaking up?
JERRY: You're bringing a date to a party?
JERRY: You're busted!
JERRY: You're complaining about a private jet?
JERRY: You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
JERRY: You're damn right you're not buying it!
JERRY: You're doing this yourself?
JERRY: You're engaged!
JERRY: You're engaged?
JERRY: You're engaged?
JERRY: You're flesh and blood.
JERRY: You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy? GEORGE: Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself. ELAINE: See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all. GEORGE: It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience! George realises that everyone in the coffee shop is staring over at him, and has heard his shouts. GEORGE: Not you. Elaine is again sitting up in bed, watching a video. The soundtrack can be heard. OLD WOMAN: Oh, brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain. The phone rings and Elaine picks up. ELAINE: Hello. VINCENT: Elaine? It's Vincent. ELAINE: Vincent. Where are you? I have to meet you. VINCENT: No. I can't bear to have anyone see me. ELAINE: Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. Now, let's have a look at you. VINCENT: Alright, but, can you bring me few things from the store? I haven't been out in a while. Kramer drives along the street, very slowly. He's got traffic stacked up behind him and horns blare as cars manoeuvre around him. Kramer is hunched over the steering wheel, looking nervous. KRAMER: Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed. Kramer stands expectantly in the office. A secretary enters. SECRETARY: Hi, can I help you? KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will. SECRETARY: Oh. Mr Kramer, you had a ten-thirty appointment. It's two o'clock. Mr Shellbach had a tennis lesson. He's gone for the day. Kramer looks anxious again. Jerry and Milos are playing at the other tennis club. They are watched by a small number of people, including Patty. Milos delivers a weak underarm serve, and Jerry makes no effort to return it, merely wafting his racquet vaguely in the direction of the ball.
JERRY: You're getting married?

George: They're shooting! They're shooting! Tim: Alright, get down! The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, Eva has fallen on top of George. Eva. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you. George: That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you. Eva: But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything. Tim returns. Tim: Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up. Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling it sensually.
JERRY: You're not gonna get the job.
JERRY: You're not gonna have any?
JERRY: You're not paying
JERRY: You're not paying for it.
JERRY: You're not qualified to work at the catalog. Kramer: Hey. What's wrong? Elaine: Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog. Kramer: Where?
JERRY: You're not writing any letters!
JERRY: You're nuts!
JERRY: You're off bread. . . . So what happened is it over?
JERRY: You're on fire today. MILOS: Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful! Patty blows Milos a kiss. MILOS: He's not a man, this Jerry. He's not even married like I am. Huhuhuhu.

George sits on the couch, just making sure he's got Jerry's story straight. Jerry listens. GEORGE: So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?

JUDGE: That'll be seventy-five dollars. Newman: What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
JUDGE: That's enough already.
JUDGE: Uh, continue.
JUDGE: Uh, could you get to the speeding?
JUDY: Hello. Jean-Paul: I'm a friend of Elaine's.
JUDY: Hey! What about lunch?
JUDY: Hey!!!!.
JUDY: Hi, Elaine. How are you?
JUDY: It is my pleasure , just make sure you give that manuscript a good read.
JUDY: Oh, hi. Jean-Paul: oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager
JUDY: Read it twice if you have to. This is a big step in your career.
JUDY: Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it.
JUDY: Yeah. I'm sure they Fedexed you a manuscript. They want to see that you can read an unpublished work and give insightful criticism.
JUDY: You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!
JULIE: Although at times can be rather pedantic.
JULIE: And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.
JULIE: George, all I did was hand someone a bag.
JULIE: Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.
JULIE: Here's your big salad.
JULIE: Hi Jerry.
JULIE: Hi.
JULIE: I like Anna ???'s column and Sapphire. Don't you like Sapphire?
JULIE: I like your shirt too.
JULIE: I'm crazy about Merlot.
JULIE: No, no. I'd like to take you out.
JULIE: Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this.
JULIE: Oh, thank you.
JULIE: Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?
JULIE: Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.
JULIE: Okay, thanks, George.
JULIE: Please come, Elaine.
JULIE: Sorry e're late.
JULIE: Sure, George.
JULIE: That's what I'm suggesting.
JULIE: Um, did she?
JULIE: Well I like it, too.
JULIE: Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?
JULIE: Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.
JULIE: Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.
JULIO: Awright. Julio walks away as the elevator arrives. Jerry and Elaine step aboard.
JULIO: Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry.
JULIO: Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to people, huh?
JULIO: Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld, maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each
KAREN: As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
KAREN: But I've never sung before in my life!
KAREN: Hi, Kramer.
KAREN: I am in your hands. Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. Kenneth will take you home.
KAREN: I like your shirt.
KAREN: I love Merlot.
KAREN: I really wanted you.
KAREN: I'm a little nervous!
KAREN: It must have been an accident.
KAREN: Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
KAREN: Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
KAREN: Magic.
KAREN: Mom, Dad.
KAREN: My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
KAREN: No good?
KAREN: No, no...it's OK Go on.
KAREN: Oh, so do I.
KAREN: OK, this is it!
KAREN: Really.
KAREN: Six.
KAREN: That makes sense.
KAREN: They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water! KRAMER: Well, how did this happen?
KAREN: Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?
KAREN: Well, I'm wearing this red dress -
KAREN: Well, what could she have done?
KAREN: What else?
KAREN: Why?
KAREN: Yes, I see. OK
KAREN: You really know a lot about this, don't you?
KARIN: Because I said so.
KARIN: Generally.
KARIN: Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
KARIN: I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
KARIN: I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
KARIN: I'd like you to leave.
KARIN: I'm very satisfied.
KARIN: Jerry?
KARIN: Maybe.
KARIN: No, I feel full after the Risotto.
KARIN: Oh George, oooh.
KARIN: Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
KARIN: Well hurry up.
KARIN: Well, it's not like after the Risotto.
KARIN: What are you talking about?
KARIN: What do you mean it's not necessary?
KARIN: What, what?
KARIN: You think I was faking?
KARL: I 'm gonna have to seal the place up for 48 hours and fog it. That's the only way to get rid of them.
KARL: I don't explain 'em Mr. Seinfeld. I just exterminate them.
KARL: Well , unless you want to kill them. They can't stay in here. This stuff is pretty toxic. I'll go get my stuff, it's in the truck.
KARL: Yep!...In your bedroom too Mr. Seinfeld. You've got a full outbreak of fleas on your hands.
KATHY LEE: But he's adorable.
KATHY LEE: Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one.
KATHY LEE: I did.
KATHY LEE: I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!
KATHY LEE: I love his hair.
KATHY LEE: I love this.
KATHY LEE: I want one of these.
KATHY LEE: Is that fabulous?
KATHY LEE: Please, please.
KATHY LEE: This coffee table is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.
KATHY LEE: Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!
KATIE: And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James.
KATIE: Because even if you have to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.
KATIE: By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience.
KATIE: Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this.
KATIE: George, George, you're on.
KATIE: I heard what happened to the junior high. They can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional.
KATIE: I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.
KATIE: I knew it.
KATIE: I see you're having coffee. Just so you know, they also have decaf as well. Along with a selection of cocktails and soft...
KATIE: I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?]
KATIE: I'm not sure.
KATIE: I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.
KATIE: It didn't go very well, did it?
KATIE: It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week.
KATIE: Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
KATIE: Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-
KATIE: Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it.
KATIE: Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone.
KATIE: Jerry.
KATIE: Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry.
KATIE: Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?
KATIE: Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?
KATIE: Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.
KATIE: Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly.
KATIE: Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you.
KATIE: Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. Katie works for Jerry.
KATIE: Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference?
KATIE: Okay, you're a big celebrity.
KATIE: One of you has to go on.
KATIE: Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show.
KATIE: Sorry for the late notice.
KATIE: The eight will get you in a little earlier.
KATIE: There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want?
KATIE: They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls.
KATIE: Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--
KATIE: Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out.
KATIE: Yeah, it's eight in the morning.
KATIE: Yes.
KATIE: You found the airport all right?
KATIE: You told me not to bother you with minor details.
KATIE: You're the--
KATYA:
KATYA: Ah, Misha!
KATYA: And you could not refuse.
KATYA: He was a very bad dictator.
KATYA: He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.
KATYA: I can balance myself in any position.
KATYA: In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the Comedian. You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian.
KATYA: It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.
KATYA: It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.
KATYA: It is horrible!
KATYA: Misha, this is Jerry.
KATYA: My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.
KATYA: Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.
KATYA: So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?
KATYA: Yes. We are here.
KEITH: Can I help you?
KEITH: I don't have to but I will. Street
KEITH: Leave ...
KEITH: Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But...
KEITH: Not with ...
KEITH: Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
KEITH: Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..
KEN: ...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here. Ken grabs the suitcase from by the door and they exit, hurriedly.
KEN: Are you okay, honey?
KEN: Doctor says it could be any day now.
KEN: George! She's in labour!
KEN: George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!! Ken strides into the delivery room.
KEN: How about Joan?
KEN: Just keep breathing, okay.
KEN: Now's not the best time, George!
KEN: Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the hospital...
KEN: Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.
KEN: Okay.
KEN: Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. It's very unusual.
KEN: Well, we don't care for Soda.
KEN: What is it?
KEN: What?
KEN: Why can't we use Seven?
KEN: Yeah, but uh... Soda?
KEN: You don't like Kimberley?
KERI: And a tin of altoids. Jerry puts it all in his pocket and then trying to catch up to her
KERI: And can you help to carry my keys? Jerry looks at the keys.
KERI: Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?
KERI: Do you still have my lipstick?
KERI: Guess not.
KERI: My job was to keep you away from the music.
KERI: Nice.
KERI: Ready to go?
KERI: You don't go that often?
KERIL: Nice carryall.
KERNIS: I hear you, guy.
KERNIS: Sorry.
KERNIS: Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?
KID: But I want a racing car set.
KID: Commie, Commie, Commie . . . .
KID: Hey, this guy's a COMMIE!
KID: Hey, you're riding a girl's bike. Kramer thumbs his nose and continues pedalling.
KID: I want a racing car set.
KID: No Barney! ROBIN: Maybe a clown.
KID: This guy's a Commie. He's spreading propoganda.
KID: Who's Bozo?
KIM: Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us.
KIM: Frank?
KIM: I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.
KIM: No.
KIM: Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off.
KIM: That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight.
KIM: Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this.
KIM: You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever want to see you again.
KIMBROUGH: And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
KIMBROUGH: Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.
KIMBROUGH: Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, Jerry, that he developed five years ago.
KIMBROUGH: Can I get you anything?
KIMBROUGH: He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.
KIMBROUGH: Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.
KIMBROUGH: Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?
KIMBROUGH: Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.
KIMBROUGH: That's right.
KIMBROUGH: What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.
KIMBROUGH: Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.
KLEIN: His buttocks are sublime!
KLEIN: Interesting face..
KLEIN: Sit down, eh? You're very lean, but muscular..
KLEIN: You're spectacular.
KLEIN: You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful.

KRAMER: Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.
KRAMER: Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.

KRAMER: Alright, IÂ’ll get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
KRAMER: Alright, lean forward, relax.
KRAMER: Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. Now, I don't caer where you're
KRAMER: Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
KRAMER: Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
KRAMER: Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. So I give hime the crook-eye back, you

KRAMER: Alright.
KRAMER: Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
KRAMER: Alright. I'm ready. You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
KRAMER: Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
KRAMER: Alright.. How do you like this? Ya!
KRAMER: Alright.. yeah.. alright, have a good one.
KRAMER: Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
KRAMER: An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
KRAMER: An In The Park Home Run!
KRAMER: Anatoly! Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
KRAMER: And Buck Showalter's?
KRAMER: And go we will.
KRAMER: And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
KRAMER: And I have a lot more control . I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees .
KRAMER: And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing your jacket...
KRAMER: And it could be done.
KRAMER: And laughter is the best medicine.
KRAMER: And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this guy. We trusted you.
KRAMER: And she doesn't know anything about this?
KRAMER: And that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity! ELAINE: Oh, pleeeeease.
KRAMER: And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
KRAMER: And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince. HIPPIE #1: Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.
KRAMER: And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
KRAMER: And to the bathroom. Jerry, George and Kramer: Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...
KRAMER: And we all know how painful that can be.
KRAMER: And we're off.
KRAMER: And with DarrenÂ’s help, weÂ’ll get that chicken.
KRAMER: And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
KRAMER: And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
KRAMER: And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
KRAMER: And you'll get it back.
KRAMER: And you're going to go out with her.
KRAMER: And you're saying she's deaf.
KRAMER: And..voila!
KRAMER: And?
KRAMER: Another Festivus miracle!
KRAMER: Antonio. In here!
KRAMER: Any news?
KRAMER: Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
KRAMER: Anything new on that guy on drugs?
KRAMER: Anything you wish.. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes: They're meaningless!
KRAMER: Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
KRAMER: Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
KRAMER: Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
KRAMER: Are they war veterans? Elaine looks at him confused.
KRAMER: Are those shoes comfortable?
KRAMER: Are we getting this?
KRAMER: Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
KRAMER: Are you gonna need this?
KRAMER: Are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you really want to have fun?!
KRAMER: Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go? Fireman: I drive the back of the truck.
KRAMER: Are you still on the pill?
KRAMER: Are you up?
KRAMER: Arrest?
KRAMER: As soon as the game is over..
KRAMER: Ashtrays?
KRAMER: Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
KRAMER: Assman.
KRAMER: At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right , we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
KRAMER: Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
KRAMER: Aw, beautiful!
KRAMER: Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
KRAMER: Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
KRAMER: Aw, you really hurting, huh?
KRAMER: Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
KRAMER: Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
KRAMER: Awright, my work is done here. Kramer heads for the door.
KRAMER: b'd b'd Doubleday offices
KRAMER: Bad news, my friend.
KRAMER: Bailing?
KRAMER: Bald?
KRAMER: Because I don't have a table . Elaine walks in
KRAMER: Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My osteopath says it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter
KRAMER: Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him?
KRAMER: Because I'm a pod?
KRAMER: Because I'm going to e playing golf at the Westchester country club. Hum.
KRAMER: Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this I'm only showing eight fingers.
KRAMER: Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
KRAMER: Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
KRAMER: Because it's no good.
KRAMER: Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
KRAMER: Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
KRAMER: Because of the coffee thing? Mr.Lippman: Kramer, I'm sorry.
KRAMER: Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
KRAMER: Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body. Or a shirt..
KRAMER: Because we're engaged.
KRAMER: Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
KRAMER: Because you're silly. Get it? Yeah...
KRAMER: Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
KRAMER: Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance!
KRAMER: Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
KRAMER: Bennette right ?
KRAMER: Best two out of three? One spot, two spot..
KRAMER: Bet? Um, not betting.
KRAMER: Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
KRAMER: Big mistake.
KRAMER: Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
KRAMER: Blood!
KRAMER: Bombs away .
KRAMER: Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
KRAMER: Boy , you're looking sharp there Tim.
KRAMER: Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home in a body bag.
KRAMER: Boy, I am really surprised at you. You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I
KRAMER: Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the
KRAMER: Boy, it's too bad you gave me this one too.
KRAMER: Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
KRAMER: Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
KRAMER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?
KRAMER: Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
KRAMER: Boy...
KRAMER: Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.
KRAMER: Break up with her
KRAMER: Bro!

KRAMER: Buenos dias.
KRAMER: Buenos dias.
KRAMER: Bulimic,
KRAMER: But first, we're talking with Jerry. Okay, Jerry, uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy collection. How do you feel about that?
KRAMER: But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
KRAMER: BUT I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING. Kramer is seen running down the street with his vertical lift shoes. He's
KRAMER: But I did sit in mud.
KRAMER: But I don't want the levels!
KRAMER: But I want to--
KRAMER: But I'm tired..
KRAMER: But it's a lock, Jerry!
KRAMER: But it's Festivus.
KRAMER: But Jackie--
KRAMER: But now I have a big problem, buddy.
KRAMER: But she really looks like a Lily
KRAMER: But that's not Hello.
KRAMER: But they do and they are the ones writing it off .
KRAMER: But wasn't that taken off the market?
KRAMER: But what am I gonna do for fruit?
KRAMER: But where does the meat go?
KRAMER: But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
KRAMER: But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
KRAMER: But you haven't seen..
KRAMER: But you will use... a retractor.
KRAMER: But, it's only a toy!
KRAMER: Bye!!
KRAMER: Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
KRAMER: Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.
KRAMER: C'mon , c'mon what's the matter?
KRAMER: C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry. George; All right now we're going bye bye.
KRAMER: C'mon it's my turn.
KRAMER: C'mon Seattle, let's go.
KRAMER: C'mon!
KRAMER: C'mon, do you wanna go?

KRAMER: C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!
KRAMER: C'mon, let's go.
KRAMER: C'mon, what d'you say?
KRAMER: C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.. Jerry, you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
KRAMER: Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.
KRAMER: Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for. .
KRAMER: CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
KRAMER: Can I get in on that?
KRAMER: Can I sleep with you?
KRAMER: Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
KRAMER: Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
KRAMER: Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.

KRAMER: Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's
KRAMER: Course I will. These are staples.
KRAMER: Crazy Joe Devola.

KRAMER: Disaster.
KRAMER: Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt. Jerry picks up the phone.
KRAMER: Do I think? He's repugnant. Elaine fiddles with the hair, trying to make it not look so bad. It doesn't work.

KRAMER: I donÂ’t know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havenÂ’t been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. IÂ’m clueless. Is that clock right?
KRAMER: I donÂ’t understand. Father-priest: Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be
KRAMER: I donÂ’t want a carpet sweeper. They donÂ’t do anything.
KRAMER: I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...
KRAMER: I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
KRAMER: I find you extremely ugly...
KRAMER: I forgot. Wait. Never mind. Jerry and Alex walking.
KRAMER: I found it on the road.
KRAMER: I got a stone.
KRAMER: I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
KRAMER: I got it at Joe's.
KRAMER: I got it! This time, I got it!
KRAMER: I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
KRAMER: I got it. Yep.
KRAMER: I got mugged.
KRAMER: I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
KRAMER: I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.: I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
KRAMER: I got them too.
KRAMER: I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
KRAMER: I gotta find another shower.
KRAMER: I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
KRAMER: I guess I hit the snooze...
KRAMER: I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
KRAMER: I guess she was hot.
KRAMER: I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow. George is walking down the street looking down at his map. He is bumping into people.
KRAMER: I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... ...I get up!
KRAMER: I have no concentration!
KRAMER: I have to?
KRAMER: I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
KRAMER: I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
KRAMER: I here you make a pretty mean calzone .
KRAMER: I I I
KRAMER: I just assume not sit next to you.
KRAMER: I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
KRAMER: I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
KRAMER: I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
KRAMER: I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
KRAMER: I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
KRAMER: I just need it, that's all.
KRAMER: I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
KRAMER: I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
KRAMER: I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
KRAMER: I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
KRAMER: I knew you would.
KRAMER: I know but I... Little problem.
KRAMER: I know how to handle these psychotics. George comes in wearing a huge cowboy hat.
KRAMER: I know how to sign. Kramer and Laura are arguing back and forth with sign language. They are gesturing signs fiercely. One of Laura's signs causes her hand to swing backwards and hit George in the face.
KRAMER: I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but itÂ’s business as usual at Kramerica.
KRAMER: I know that guy... Y'know, he looks familiar to me, too. Reminds me of this guy John Grossbard that I knew a while back. Got me involved in one of those shady pyramid schemes... Man, if I ever meet up with him again...
KRAMER: I know what this is about Father. I didnÂ’t do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. ItÂ’s just that, that I have
KRAMER: I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
KRAMER: I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
KRAMER: I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless.
KRAMER: I know, Jerry. It's okay. Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him
KRAMER: I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
KRAMER: I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
KRAMER: I like 'em all
KRAMER: I like mangos.
KRAMER: I like Ring Dings.
KRAMER: I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
KRAMER: I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
KRAMER: I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... Bran lakes...100
KRAMER: I like to strain the sauce.
KRAMER: I like what you've done with that .
KRAMER: I liked Marlene. What's her number?
KRAMER: I live for Merlot.
KRAMER: I loathe you...
KRAMER: I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
KRAMER: I lost my balance.
KRAMER: I love you, too, buddy, and George--
KRAMER: I made a mistake.
KRAMER: I may be old, but I'm spry.
KRAMER: I may have to drive that place out of business.
KRAMER: I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ?
KRAMER: I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
KRAMER: I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wated it!
KRAMER: I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
KRAMER: I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Couldn't respect myself.
KRAMER: I need to talk to you. Lloyd and Kramer go away to the side of the lobby, where they go into a quiet
KRAMER: I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
KRAMER: I never had an air conditioner.
KRAMER: I never take it.
KRAMER: I never thought I'd live to see that..
KRAMER: I only got hundreds.
KRAMER: I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
KRAMER: I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy? Kramer starts to walk out, Jerry grabs him by the shirttail and drags him back.
KRAMER: I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
KRAMER: I said  Jump. Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said  Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop
KRAMER: I said  Wave to me when you pass my window.
KRAMER: I said how come it's taking so long?
KRAMER: I saw a couple of other guys out there.
KRAMER: I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
KRAMER: I saw the whole thing!
KRAMER: I say Japan.
KRAMER: I say we get him.
KRAMER: I see.
KRAMER: I see..
KRAMER: I still don't understand what the problem is having her in the building.
KRAMER: I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
KRAMER: I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
KRAMER: I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out!
KRAMER: I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time
KRAMER: I sure am.
KRAMER: I take baths.
KRAMER: I tell y'a it was a grind trying to fill 10 hours a week. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
KRAMER: I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. I'll be right back.
KRAMER: I tell you.
KRAMER: I think he looks fantastic.
KRAMER: I think I gotta go to the doctor! Oh, mama! MR. PITT: How long does it usually take?
KRAMER: I think it got the dog!
KRAMER: I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
KRAMER: I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
KRAMER: I think she liked me.
KRAMER: I think she was happy someone finally said it.
KRAMER: I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
KRAMER: I think we are looking half a millimeter.
KRAMER: I thought I DID!
KRAMER: I thought I heard you.
KRAMER: I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.
KRAMER: I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
KRAMER: I thought it was a closet.
KRAMER: I thought we were friends...
KRAMER: I thought we would blend in.
KRAMER: I thought you said it was a scratch.
KRAMER: I thought you took the test.
KRAMER: I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
KRAMER: I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
KRAMER: I told you I was gonna get it.
KRAMER: I told you she liked me.
KRAMER: I told you this is all I got .
KRAMER: I told you, I threw it out.
KRAMER: I told you.
KRAMER: I told you.
KRAMER: I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner!
KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, sheÂ’s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, sheÂ’s going to kill me.
KRAMER: I want restitution.
KRAMER: I want to capture this.
KRAMER: I want to talk to Calvin.
KRAMER: I was all dirty!
KRAMER: I was going to dump this.
KRAMER: I was never able to become a banker.
KRAMER: I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
KRAMER: I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
KRAMER: I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
KRAMER: I went back with Ellen.
KRAMER: I went down to Madeline's. I told her, You gotta move, or it's over.
KRAMER: I will lose that nail.
KRAMER: I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
KRAMER: I wouldn't walk over there.
KRAMER: I wouldnÂ’t set foot in your house.
KRAMER: I yearn.
KRAMER: I'd be happy to.
KRAMER: I'd like to have shoehorn hands. At Monk's.
KRAMER: I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
KRAMER: I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!
KRAMER: I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
KRAMER: I'll bet I can guess it.
KRAMER: I'll break.
KRAMER: I'll bring back the pot.
KRAMER: I'll do it.
KRAMER: I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
KRAMER: I'll get that too.
KRAMER: I'll go get your hat, George.
KRAMER: I'll have a brewsky , Charlie.
KRAMER: I'll let her down easy. All right. Well, hi Olive. No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
KRAMER: I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
KRAMER: I'll show ya Rusty.
KRAMER: I'LL TAKE IT!!
KRAMER: I'll take it.
KRAMER: I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
KRAMER: I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously
KRAMER: I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
KRAMER: I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
KRAMER: I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh... Jerry swerves into another lane. Lamar, the driver of the maroon Golf honks the horn.
KRAMER: I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'
KRAMER: I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
KRAMER: I'm a guest of honor.
KRAMER: I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
KRAMER: I'm asking you!
KRAMER: I'm at the airport.
KRAMER: I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS! George: Hey, look, Kramer,
KRAMER: I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
KRAMER: I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo! Newman: You shut up!
KRAMER: I'm doin' fine.
KRAMER: I'm down.
KRAMER: I'm even more potent now!
KRAMER: I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
KRAMER: I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
KRAMER: I'm freezing. Definitely freezing. I can't stop shaking.
KRAMER: I'm fried.
KRAMER: I'm getting my pot. Kramer grabs a put from under the counter and walks out.
KRAMER: I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
KRAMER: I'm goin' to Newman's!
KRAMER: I'm going home to spatula.
KRAMER: I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
KRAMER: I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
KRAMER: I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?
KRAMER: I'm going upstairs.
KRAMER: I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
KRAMER: I'm gonna eat that later.
KRAMER: I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
KRAMER: I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
KRAMER: I'm gonna have to do something about this lining.
KRAMER: I'm good for it.
KRAMER: I'm here to talk about the ocean.
KRAMER: I'm hip.
KRAMER: I'm human
KRAMER: I'm in here. C'mon...
KRAMER: I'm in here. How's it going.
KRAMER: I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
KRAMER: I'm in. Let's go for it.
KRAMER: I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
KRAMER: I'm Kramer.
KRAMER: I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
KRAMER: I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!. End.
KRAMER: I'm not going back in there!!
KRAMER: I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
KRAMER: I'm not happy about this.
KRAMER: I'm off hot water.
KRAMER: I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio... Silvio coming up behind Kramer
KRAMER: I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
KRAMER: I'm out!
KRAMER: I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
KRAMER: I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you?
KRAMER: I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
KRAMER: I'm shaving with it.
KRAMER: I'm so tired! ELAINE: Boy, you don't look good.
KRAMER: I'm sorry Jackie.
KRAMER: I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
KRAMER: I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
KRAMER: I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!
KRAMER: I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
KRAMER: I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
KRAMER: I'm the real Peterman.
KRAMER: I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
KRAMER: I've always wanted to see this.
KRAMER: I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
KRAMER: I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
KRAMER: I've got hypothermia.
KRAMER: I've got plenty of ideas.
KRAMER: I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
KRAMER: I've gotta feed the birds.
KRAMER: I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
KRAMER: I've made an important life decision.
KRAMER: I, I saw her naked.
KRAMER: If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
KRAMER: If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
KRAMER: If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
KRAMER: If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
KRAMER: If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
KRAMER: If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
KRAMER: If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
KRAMER: Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say Hey, Carl! and he
KRAMER: In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt. Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
KRAMER: In my spare time. . You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta
KRAMER: Installed!
KRAMER: Is Elaine going?
KRAMER: Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
KRAMER: Is it over four hundred?
KRAMER: Is it? Look at this. Kramer walks off-screen and opens his shirt. On-screen, Jerry reels from the sight.
KRAMER: Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
KRAMER: Is that from Henry the Eighth?
KRAMER: Is that seat taken?
KRAMER: Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
KRAMER: Is there a tree?
KRAMER: Is thi oak?
KRAMER: Is this a joke?
KRAMER: Is this the interference?
KRAMER: Is your name Ray?
KRAMER: It felt like 8 seconds.
KRAMER: It is very obtrusive.
KRAMER: It might be . I mean whatever you want .
KRAMER: It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
KRAMER: It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
KRAMER: It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.
KRAMER: It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
KRAMER: It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.
KRAMER: It was about 1200 bucks.
KRAMER: It was an accident.
KRAMER: It was an accident.
KRAMER: It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
KRAMER: It was in my laundry.
KRAMER: It was on the seat...
KRAMER: It was pretty good, huh?
KRAMER: It was supposed to erupt.
KRAMER: It was there!
KRAMER: It will be a funky adventure.
KRAMER: It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
KRAMER: It's a business.
KRAMER: It's a con. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of
KRAMER: It's a fallacy.
KRAMER: It's a great house, pool's something? Yeah, I'll be there.
KRAMER: It's a method, Jerry. It's intense.
KRAMER: It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
KRAMER: It's a poker game... And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
KRAMER: It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?
KRAMER: It's a sweater.
KRAMER: It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
KRAMER: It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
KRAMER: It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
KRAMER: It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
KRAMER: It's all attitude..
KRAMER: It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.
KRAMER: It's all supervised.
KRAMER: It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
KRAMER: It's beautiful.
KRAMER: It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
KRAMER: It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
KRAMER: It's definitely preposterous.
KRAMER: It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
KRAMER: It's for you.
KRAMER: It's funny.
KRAMER: It's gonna be hot in a minute.
KRAMER: It's good suspension!
KRAMER: It's got an alarm that beeps!
KRAMER: It's Grossbard! Why don't these people listen to me? I don't understand...
KRAMER: It's Halloween
KRAMER: It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
KRAMER: it's in my book - Astonishing Tales of the Sea 51 people died.
KRAMER: It's Jell-O.
KRAMER: It's just a write off for them .
KRAMER: It's just me.
KRAMER: It's just Original, Jerry!
KRAMER: It's just...it's no picnic.
KRAMER: It's Kramer!
KRAMER: It's macaroni Midler.
KRAMER: It's marion's poetry. I can't take it
KRAMER: It's not going to happen again!
KRAMER: It's not illegal.
KRAMER: It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.
KRAMER: It's over four hundred?
KRAMER: It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
KRAMER: It's purple 23. Remember that. GEORGE Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
KRAMER: It's robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais which is richer and fruitier. Here's one. Twelve dollars.
KRAMER: It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
KRAMER: It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
KRAMER: It's terrible!
KRAMER: It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.
KRAMER: It's the Merv Griffin set
KRAMER: It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
KRAMER: It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Go with it.
KRAMER: It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
KRAMER: It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
KRAMER: It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it.
KRAMER: It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
KRAMER: It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
KRAMER: It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
KRAMER: It's very refreshing!
KRAMER: It's weighing on my conscience.
KRAMER: It's yellow mustard. Can you break a twenty?
KRAMER: It's your first time. He'll understand.
KRAMER: Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep, all I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken.
KRAMER: ItÂ’s a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
KRAMER: ItÂ’s good to have you back, Stan.
KRAMER: IÂ’d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They canÂ’t get out of it in 24 hours, itÂ’s a land rush.
KRAMER: IÂ’ve got the Kavorka Jerry.
KRAMER: Jackie we gotta talk.
KRAMER: Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
KRAMER: Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?
KRAMER: Jeannie left?
KRAMER: Jeez!
KRAMER: Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?
KRAMER: Jer.
KRAMER: Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
KRAMER: Jerry . . .
KRAMER: Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
KRAMER: Jerry he's a conductor.
KRAMER: Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They Fester Jerry.
KRAMER: Jerry these are lode baring walls, they're not gonna come down!
KRAMER: Jerry this peach is sub par.
KRAMER: Jerry what's the matter? In slow motion Jerry runs into the woods. At normal speed he runs behind a tree. Camera shot down on him as he starts scratching his chest.
KRAMER: Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks. Elaine enters
KRAMER: Jerry!
KRAMER: Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it, I'm on the case, buddy, I'm on the case!
KRAMER: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look..
KRAMER: Jerry! What?!
KRAMER: Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs
KRAMER: Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
KRAMER: Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
KRAMER: Jerry, check this out. Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
KRAMER: Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
KRAMER: Jerry, come on. What'd you say? Kramer and Jerry try to talk to each other by leaning back and forth, but keep missing each other. Jerry leans forward to look at Kramer, but Kramer leans back. Kramer leans forward, Jerry leans back.
KRAMER: Jerry, George got arrested.
KRAMER: Jerry, he probably had a cold.
KRAMER: Jerry, how about you?
KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing!
KRAMER: Jerry, I donÂ’t think this thing is hooked up right.
KRAMER: Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
KRAMER: Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
KRAMER: Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
KRAMER: Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
KRAMER: Jerry, I think I'm on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the
KRAMER: Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
KRAMER: Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
KRAMER: Jerry, if the man is in pain...
KRAMER: Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
KRAMER: Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. Now feel my face.
KRAMER: Jerry, itÂ’s not for people, itÂ’s for oil tankers.
KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.
KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
KRAMER: Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together.
KRAMER: Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
KRAMER: Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
KRAMER: Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch. Kramer does mimics but you can make out somebody angry saying What are you talking about, twice and then some crying)
KRAMER: Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
KRAMER: Jerry, she taped over the whole ending!
KRAMER: Jerry, she's a loser.
KRAMER: Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
KRAMER: Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
KRAMER: Jerry, that's in Sweden. George turns on the TV as Jerry runs to the window just in time to see a mob attacking his car.
KRAMER: Jerry, these people aren't just going to let themselves be flicked into the ashbin of society.
KRAMER: Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
KRAMER: Jerry, what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
KRAMER: Jerry, what is your problem?
KRAMER: Jerry, where have you been?
KRAMER: Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
KRAMER: Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
KRAMER: Jerry, you forgot your purse.
KRAMER: Jerry, you gotta help me!
KRAMER: Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
KRAMER: Jerry, you should pay that price.
KRAMER: Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
KRAMER: Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
KRAMER: Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
KRAMER: Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
KRAMER: Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
KRAMER: Jerry...
KRAMER: Jerry.... hey Jeannie.
KRAMER: Jerry? Jerry! Jerry walks in from the back room, his hair is also flat.
KRAMER: Jimmy Sherman's?

KRAMER: Junior Mints. Do you want one?
KRAMER: Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
KRAMER: Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
KRAMER: Just a little place I like to call, YouÂ’ll see.
KRAMER: Just be yourselves.
KRAMER: Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
KRAMER: Just give me another chance!
KRAMER: Just gonna find out if he's interested.
KRAMER: Just take one.
KRAMER: Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
KRAMER: Kavorka? Father-priest: It is a Latvian word which means the lure of the animal.
KRAMER: Keep away Jerry. Keep away. He closes his door.
KRAMER: Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
KRAMER: Kenny....

KRAMER: Knock game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We were getting hit by sweat!
KRAMER: Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.

KRAMER: Let's go inside the liquor store. It's freezing in here.
KRAMER: Let's go.
KRAMER: Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee. Kramer peels out. He's on a mission from God.
KRAMER: Let's go. OK,
KRAMER: Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet masculine.
KRAMER: Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
KRAMER: Let's try a few more questions, alright? If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
KRAMER: Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
KRAMER: Lets share.. we share....Awight Deensfrei Yes ! Splendid. That's a great idea.
KRAMER: LetÂ’s see what Jerry has to eat.
KRAMER: Levels.

KRAMER: Like the big toe captain..
KRAMER: Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
KRAMER: Liked me.
KRAMER: Lindsay olives, Jerry.
KRAMER: Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!
KRAMER: Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
KRAMER: Listen to this, If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke.  That's a rule, Jerry.
KRAMER: Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
KRAMER: Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
KRAMER: Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.
KRAMER: Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
KRAMER: Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King. G+E: No, wait!
KRAMER: Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses. Kramer reaches across and plucks the glasses from Jerry's face.
KRAMER: Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
KRAMER: Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
KRAMER: Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
KRAMER: Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
KRAMER: Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
KRAMER: Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
KRAMER: Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
KRAMER: Loan her the money. You can afford it.
KRAMER: Lock and load.
KRAMER: Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.
KRAMER: Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was
KRAMER: Look at hose babies . They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
KRAMER: Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
KRAMER: Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
KRAMER: Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
KRAMER: Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
KRAMER: Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
KRAMER: Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gold is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
KRAMER: Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
KRAMER: Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees! They find an arrival/departure screen thingie:
KRAMER: Look at you! You've got another gig!
KRAMER: Look away, I'm hideous.

KRAMER: Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?
KRAMER: Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
KRAMER: Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
KRAMER: Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.

KRAMER: Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
KRAMER: Looking for this?
KRAMER: Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh?
KRAMER: Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that. Kramer exits.

KRAMER: That guy.. He was just...
KRAMER: That is damn good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
KRAMER: That kid...
KRAMER: That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
KRAMER: That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it I gotta move in with you Jerry.
KRAMER: That looks like a dog with a glove on his head. New scene - Kurt at George's door. Celia answers.
KRAMER: That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
KRAMER: That musta been some kind of doll.
KRAMER: That smell. What's that smell?

KRAMER: That's definitely you.
KRAMER: That's East River.

KRAMER: That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
KRAMER: That's right, 'cause they already saw it.
KRAMER: That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.

KRAMER: Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
KRAMER: Well, I overbought! MR. ROSS: George.
KRAMER: Well, I practically raised his kids.
KRAMER: Well, I say we're going to take our money right now! Newman enters
KRAMER: Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
KRAMER: Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
KRAMER: Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
KRAMER: Well, I tell time by the sun.
KRAMER: Well, I think one of us should leave. They stare at each other for a while, then the scene cuts to Monks.
KRAMER: Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
KRAMER: Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like American Gladiators.
KRAMER: Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
KRAMER: Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha --
KRAMER: Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
KRAMER: Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and Jerry tipped him off.
KRAMER: Well, I was just trying to help out.
KRAMER: Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
KRAMER: Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
KRAMER: Well, I'll think of something..
KRAMER: Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
KRAMER: Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
KRAMER: Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not an idiot.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not giving it back.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive.
KRAMER: Well, I'm off to the links.
KRAMER: Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
KRAMER: Well, I'm staining my floors and, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
KRAMER: Well, I'm taking this back.
KRAMER: Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
KRAMER: Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
KRAMER: Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
KRAMER: Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
KRAMER: Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
KRAMER: Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
KRAMER: Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh,
KRAMER: Well, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
KRAMER: Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
KRAMER: Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
KRAMER: Well, is it good?
KRAMER: Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
KRAMER: Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
KRAMER: Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
KRAMER: Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.
KRAMER: Well, it's a rare archival print. Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if
KRAMER: Well, it's a style. Jerry give me the keys. Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
KRAMER: Well, it's a valuable appendage. New scene - Elaine in her office at work, talking with two co-workers.
KRAMER: Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
KRAMER: Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool.
KRAMER: Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything: Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we
KRAMER: Well, it's chicken feed.
KRAMER: Well, it's common sense.
KRAMER: Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air.
KRAMER: Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. It's a walk out!
KRAMER: Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert.
KRAMER: Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out. Newman stops under a tree on the street and looking up into it.
KRAMER: Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
KRAMER: Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
KRAMER: Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to
KRAMER: Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
KRAMER: Well, it's your phone. He wanted to talk to you
KRAMER: Well, itÂ’d be our little secret.
KRAMER: Well, itÂ’s a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If IÂ’m gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itÂ’ll handle my daily routine.
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now. Elaine approaches the group. She is totally disheveled with popcorn in her hair and her clothing stained.
KRAMER: Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
KRAMER: Well, just save me a seat.
KRAMER: Well, just tell me everything, huh?
KRAMER: Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
KRAMER: Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we? Kramer ducks behind the counter to retrieve the lost and found box.
KRAMER: Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.
KRAMER: Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives
KRAMER: Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
KRAMER: Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a real favor.
KRAMER: Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
KRAMER: Well, maybe I did overextend myself. O'NEILL: How the heck did you get in here anyway?
KRAMER: Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
KRAMER: Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time: people are a little shy, a little reticent.
KRAMER: Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
KRAMER: Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
KRAMER: Well, more bad news Jerry. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY
KRAMER: Well, move in here.
KRAMER: Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very
KRAMER: Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
KRAMER: Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator. George: Yeah, your milk.
KRAMER: Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
KRAMER: Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
KRAMER: Well, NewmanÂ’s upstairs visiting Martin.
KRAMER: Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
KRAMER: Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle. INT. LISI'S APARTMENT - DAY
KRAMER: Well, not here.
KRAMER: Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
KRAMER: Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
KRAMER: Well, now I can't see Jerry.
KRAMER: Well, now look, just leave me alone.
KRAMER: Well, now what are we gonna do? See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
KRAMER: Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.
KRAMER: Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
KRAMER: Well, she asked you.
KRAMER: Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
KRAMER: Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride. Kramer opens the door and rides clumsily out, ringing the bell as he
KRAMER: Well, that is strange.
KRAMER: Well, that makes sense. Want some chicken?
KRAMER: Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
KRAMER: Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
KRAMER: Well, that wouldn't be kosher.
KRAMER: Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
KRAMER: Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
KRAMER: Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
KRAMER: Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
KRAMER: Well, that's out of the question.
KRAMER: Well, that's weird.
KRAMER: Well, thatÂ’s a weird thing to say..
KRAMER: Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he , he bolted.
KRAMER: Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
KRAMER: Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she was going to think about it.
KRAMER: Well, then, he's out!
KRAMER: Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
KRAMER: Well, there is something you can do.
KRAMER: Well, there's only one way to settle this. One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
KRAMER: Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur! Elaine pushing Kramer in her 'get-out!' style.
KRAMER: Well, they're in...
KRAMER: Well, they're slim-fit.
KRAMER: Well, this is a surprise ha?
KRAMER: Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.
KRAMER: Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even bet you.
KRAMER: Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
KRAMER: Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
KRAMER: Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. What's worse - he has a nagging cough. Yeah, that's it. That's it.
KRAMER: Well, uh.. What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?
KRAMER: Well, we'll have to improvise.
KRAMER: Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
KRAMER: Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
KRAMER: Well, we've officially bottomed out. Who's our next guest?
KRAMER: Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each
KRAMER: Well, what are you waiting for?
KRAMER: Well, what did you do next?
KRAMER: Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
KRAMER: Well, what happened to your nose?
KRAMER: Well, what have you been doing?
KRAMER: Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
KRAMER: Well, what's the matter?
KRAMER: Well, where the meat goes?
KRAMER: Well, where's the soup?
KRAMER: Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
KRAMER: Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
KRAMER: Well, why don't you do your material?
KRAMER: Well, why donÂ’t you take your clothes off?
KRAMER: Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill?
KRAMER: Well, why no T-bone?!
KRAMER: Well, why not.
KRAMER: Well, why not?
KRAMER: Well, why?
KRAMER: Well, wow.
KRAMER: Well, yeah, lets do it uh?

KRAMER: Well, you better get on the horn.
KRAMER: Well, you better get to work.
KRAMER: Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... Oh, oh, oh, YEAH! MR. PITT: I don't see it.
KRAMER: Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no fine touch...
KRAMER: Well, you can get 'em back.
KRAMER: Well, you can't leave now.
KRAMER: Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
KRAMER: Well, you gotta give him some credit. You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps
KRAMER: Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
KRAMER: Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
KRAMER: Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' them!
KRAMER: Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
KRAMER: Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
KRAMER: Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
KRAMER: Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now. HIPPIE #1: Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?
KRAMER: Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
KRAMER: Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
KRAMER: Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
KRAMER: Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
KRAMER: Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
KRAMER: Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
KRAMER: Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
KRAMER: Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
KRAMER: Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
KRAMER: Well, you were right.
KRAMER: Well, you won't regret it. (Kramer looks up at Newman and he sees him close to kissing Silvio's wife. Silvio, sees the cigar fall right out of Kramer's mouth.
KRAMER: Well, you'd better take it easy. Kramer grabs a coat and helmet and heads towards the back of the truck.
KRAMER: Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
KRAMER: Well, you're going over there.
KRAMER: Well, you're not checked at on it.
KRAMER: Well, youÂ’re still here?

KRAMER: Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
KRAMER: Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman.
KRAMER: Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
KRAMER: Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
KRAMER: Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.
KRAMER: Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them!
KRAMER: Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
KRAMER: Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
KRAMER: Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
KRAMER: Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
KRAMER: Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
KRAMER: Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
KRAMER: Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
KRAMER: Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
KRAMER: Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.
KRAMER: Yeah, come in.

KRAMER: Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids... MR. PITT: I still don't see it.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's a windshield.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up so it melts. Newman stirs the hot tub with a lacrosse stick, licking his lips and working

KRAMER: yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though. Jerry slaps him in the back.
KRAMER: Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.

KRAMER: Yeah, well, alright. IÂ’m satisfied. We better get some gas.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.

KRAMER: Yeah... So c'mon, what d'you say?
KRAMER: Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here. There is a Puerto Rican family in the car.
KRAMER: Yeah?
KRAMER: Yeah? FRIEND 1: Ramirez has never heard your pants story.
KRAMER: Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself In a sporting goods store, George tries to make a sale. He is putting on

KRAMER: Yes , yes . I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic . I need Elaine Benes chart . She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it . It's uh very

KRAMER: Yes I did.
KRAMER: Yes sweep.
KRAMER: Yes!
KRAMER: Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now. Kramer gets in the car. George shows up and climbs into the back seat.

KRAMER: Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, you did good George.

KRAMER: Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
KRAMER: Yes, that's my contention.
KRAMER: Yes, that's true.
KRAMER: Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE! New scene - Jerry in he and George's hotel room on the floor above Karen's. George enters.
KRAMER: Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.
KRAMER: Yes, yes I am.
KRAMER: Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
KRAMER: Yes, yes! You said it!
KRAMER: Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta IÂ’ve still got time to catch her.
KRAMER: Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, - this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!

KRAMER: You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there Jerry; Oh! my God!....
KRAMER: You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus.
KRAMER: You can't get a refund . Your warranty expired two years ago .
KRAMER: You can't get a stool in here.
KRAMER: You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
KRAMER: You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here.
KRAMER: You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something!
KRAMER: You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
KRAMER: You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
KRAMER: You did.
KRAMER: You didn't do so bad.
KRAMER: You didn't get the blood from me.

KRAMER: You got butchered. George faints.
KRAMER: You got cigars , huh .
KRAMER: You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
KRAMER: You got it?
KRAMER: You got money?
KRAMER: You got ripped buddy .
KRAMER: You got that right! A kid leans out the window of a parked Volvo.
KRAMER: You got that straight!
KRAMER: You got that straight.
KRAMER: You gotta come through with the hips first.
KRAMER: You gotta play him like me. I'm Karmer.
KRAMER: You guys ready?
KRAMER: You just blew my mind.
KRAMER: You just gotta mention my name.
KRAMER: You just tear it off, and you got a new one right here. Then you're gone.
KRAMER: You keep him busy.
KRAMER: You keep me posted!
KRAMER: You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
KRAMER: You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
KRAMER: You know I can't find a match anywhere.
KRAMER: You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
KRAMER: You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
KRAMER: You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can
KRAMER: You know I never got a library card.
KRAMER: You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
KRAMER: You know that, uh, Leslie is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
KRAMER: You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you. JERRYL Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
KRAMER: You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell.
KRAMER: You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
KRAMER: You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return this.
KRAMER: You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
KRAMER: You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
KRAMER: You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop: Regis and Kathy Lee.
KRAMER: You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully.
KRAMER: You know who you are? Even Steven Cut to G's car; G and Victoria driving
KRAMER: You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
KRAMER: You know you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical and Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
KRAMER: You know you're going to.
KRAMER: You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
KRAMER: You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
KRAMER: You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
KRAMER: You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
KRAMER: You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
KRAMER: You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
KRAMER: You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
KRAMER: You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
KRAMER: You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
KRAMER: You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a piece.
KRAMER: You know, I faked it.
KRAMER: You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
KRAMER: You know, I really like that hairdo. Jerry and Elaine both look surprised and let-down by Kramer.
KRAMER: You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I had two lives. My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
KRAMER: You know, I think you're jealous.
KRAMER: You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
KRAMER: You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
KRAMER: You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica?
KRAMER: You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers. O'NEILL: You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home runs?
KRAMER: You know, maybe in Korean dog isn't an insult. Could be like the word fox to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
KRAMER: You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
KRAMER: You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
KRAMER: You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
KRAMER: You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted .. okay. One day, you'll beg me to make your own pie.
KRAMER: You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
KRAMER: You know, uh, oftentimes, Jerry - he lend me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I donÂ’t want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
KRAMER: You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
KRAMER: You know, you should make yourself throw up.
KRAMER: You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist.
KRAMER: You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
KRAMER: You make your own pie!
KRAMER: You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
KRAMER: You mean you've never tasted lobster?
KRAMER: You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
KRAMER: You must be kidding.
KRAMER: You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
KRAMER: You oughta get that wire fixed. I got the door.
KRAMER: You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
KRAMER: You raise the hand, lower the head-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh! You get my drift.
KRAMER: You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
KRAMER: You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
KRAMER: You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
KRAMER: You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
KRAMER: You see I come up with these things, I know theyÂ’re gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
KRAMER: You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
KRAMER: You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
KRAMER: You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wonÂ’t spill out.
KRAMER: You see what happens when you try to be nice?
KRAMER: You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
KRAMER: You should just eat fruit.
KRAMER: You should sleep with him.
KRAMER: You should take cold showers.
KRAMER: You shoulda come, Jerry.
KRAMER: You shut up!
KRAMER: You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
KRAMER: You stink.
KRAMER: You stink. Why don't you go take a shower?
KRAMER: You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!! At the HOME FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK Kramer walks up to a teller.
KRAMER: You suffer for your soup.
KRAMER: You sure you donÂ’t want me to take my clothes off? IÂ’ll do it!
KRAMER: You sure?
KRAMER: You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
KRAMER: You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
KRAMER: You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
KRAMER: You wanna go see him?
KRAMER: You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
KRAMER: You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
KRAMER: You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
KRAMER: You want me to sleep with you?
KRAMER: You want me to talk to her?
KRAMER: You want some hot tea?
KRAMER: You want these? Knee socks. You don't wear knee socks.
KRAMER: You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
KRAMER: You wanta go get him?
KRAMER: You weren't even married yet.
KRAMER: You won't regret it. Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
KRAMER: You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
KRAMER: You'd regret it for the rest of your life.
KRAMER: You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom. Kramer leaves.
KRAMER: You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
KRAMER: You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
KRAMER: You're a human being.
KRAMER: You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet
KRAMER: You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. Hey, denty! Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
KRAMER: You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
KRAMER: You're flesh and blood.
KRAMER: You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
KRAMER: You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.
KRAMER: You're in a weird mood.
KRAMER: You're joking.
KRAMER: You're moving to California?
KRAMER: You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. Not crazy.
KRAMER: You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
KRAMER: You're not going to wear this.
KRAMER: You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
KRAMER: You're not!!!
KRAMER: You're on, cowboy!
KRAMER: You're positive it's statute?
KRAMER: You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
KRAMER: You're scared of Elaine?
KRAMER: You've been married three times.
KRAMER: You've been warned.
KRAMER: You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
KRAMER: You've got something between your teeth
KRAMER: You've never had cantaloupe like this before.
KRAMER: You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
KRAMER: YouÂ’re not going?
KRAMER: Yup! Yup!
KRAMER: Yup, yup!
KRAMER: Yyyeeaaah!!
KRAMER:: There she blows!
KRAMERT: Mmm... Nice wallet.
KRMAER: Hey.
KRMAER: Man..
KRUGER: Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.
KRUGER: Ahem. Now, what's your name?
KRUGER: All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?
KRUGER: Are you making all this up, too?
KRUGER: But there isn't.
KRUGER: For lunch?
KRUGER: George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.
KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.
KRUGER: George, I got something for you. I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference?
KRUGER: George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.
KRUGER: George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?
KRUGER: George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.
KRUGER: George. ALL: Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy!
KRUGER: Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?
KRUGER: Hey, Koko, Who's this? INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
KRUGER: Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?
KRUGER: How about George?
KRUGER: How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?
KRUGER: I don't care. Let's find you an office.
KRUGER: I find your belief system fascinating.
KRUGER: I'm not too worried about it.
KRUGER: It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?
KRUGER: Koko the monkey.
KRUGER: Let's order lunch. INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY
KRUGER: Made out to the Human Fund. Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.
KRUGER: Mary, I will have a chef's salad.
KRUGER: Maybe there should be a Gammy.
KRUGER: Not if you could see our books.. what's this?
KRUGER: Ok, good enough for me, Koko.
KRUGER: So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?
KRUGER: So, how am I looking?
KRUGER: T-bone! ALL: T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone!
KRUGER: Vemonous?
KRUGER: Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?
KRUGER: We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.
KRUGER: Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.
KRUGER: Well, then we should call you T-bone.
KRUGER: Whatever.
KRUGER: Who's Gammy?
KRUGER: Yeah, you probably should.
KRUGER: Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?
KURT: Ah, damn.
KURT: Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to. GEORGE: Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
KURT: Elaine... Will you marry me? New scene - Jerry and Kramer in Jerry's kitchen, training Little Jerry for his cockfight.
KURT: Happy? Why should I be happy?
KURT: Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life.
KURT: Hold it, hold it, I got it. Catch. ELAINE: Hey, driver's licence. Oh...my God.
KURT: How long do I have? GEORGE: 14 months. Maybe 10.
KURT: I don't care.
KURT: Is there anything I can do?
KURT: It's from yesterday. New scene - Jerry and Marcelino at the bodega.
KURT: No, no, no...it has to be now.
KURT: Oh my God! I'm going bald! New scene - George and Celia in the prison library.
KURT: Oh, God.
KURT: Plus, you want to get to know me.
KURT: They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I slugged him.
KURT: Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.
KURT: Well, how much time?
KURT: Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it.
KURT: Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?
KURT: What do you mean?
KURT: What?
KURT: Who will I be?
KURT: Yeah.
KURT: Yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.
LADY: A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
LADY: Oh! Is that cashmere?
LADY: Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.
LADY: Okay, okay, can I open it now?
LADY: That's right.
LADY: What's this? At the comedy club.
LADY: When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, what do you call this most beautiful fabric?, and he said they call it cashmere. I repeated the words cashmere, cashmere. I asked if I could have it, and he said No. Get away from me. Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.
LADY: Would you like to buy a rose for your wife?  Craig and Elaine both laugh
LADY: Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.
LAMAR: Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.
LAMAR: Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha ha ha! See ya around! He drives off.
LAMAR: Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!
LAMAR: Jackass! Jerry sets his car alarm.
LAMAR: Jackass? So I'm a jackass now? EXT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY - ESTABLISHING
LAMAR: Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab.
LAMAR: Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.
LAMAR: So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.
LAMAR: This traffic's a killer, ain't it?
LAMAR: Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.
LAMAR: What was that?
LAMAR: Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.
LAMAR: You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible. Still haven't.
LANDIS:
LANDIS: And you can't acquire grace.
LANDIS: Excuse me?
LANDIS: Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market. ELAINE: Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, OK?

LANDIS: How will you get it back?
LANDIS: I tore my umeral epicondilitist

LANDIS: Jocylin Landis from Doubleday. I interviewed you for a position a couple of months ago.
LANDIS: Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. PITT: Charmed.
LANDIS: My doctor said it might never fully heal. I may never play again.
LANDIS: No. LANDIS'S INTERCOM: Justin Pitt to see you.
LANDIS: No. You exhibited a lot of grace out there.
LANDIS: Not many people have grace.
LANDIS: Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace. ELAINE: Yes! Grace!
LANDIS: Thank you for coming in.
LANDIS: That's so generous of you.
LANDIS: We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know. ELAINE: I have no chance, do I?
LANDIS: What am I going to do?
LANDIS: Would you mind if I tried this out?
LANDIS: Yes. So have you found anything yet?
LANDIS: You can't have a little grace. You either have grace, or you...don't.
LANDIS: You don't know how lucky you are to be healthy ...
LANDIS: You know you should keep in touch. Something may be opening up in a few weeks. Is that a Bruline?
LANDLORD: A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing.
LANDLORD: He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.
LANDLORD: Hello?
LANDLORD: I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.
LANDLORD: It's too bad about your father.
LANDLORD: Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?
LANDLORD: Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?
LANDLORD: The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees,
LANDLORD: Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been
LANDLORD: Yes, your contention.
LANDLORD: You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe. Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.
LANDLORD: Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this
LARRY: I thought he was a doctor.
LARRY: I'm running in the park now, I've lost weight, we're barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable.
LARRY: It bothers people, and it's against the law.
LARRY: Oh, you don't know how grateful I am, if there's anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, we're just so
LARRY: Take it outside.
LASER GUY: Gimme a box of those and one of those.

LAURA: Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?
LAURA: Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up.
LAURA: Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.
LAURA: Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of we, uh, it's a very stressful situation.

LEFT MAN: Really? What are you gonna 'bout the apartment?
LENA: A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.
LENA: Guess who volunteered last week?
LENA: He what?
LENA: Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins.
LENA: I don't know. SUSAN: So, did you get to talk to her?
LENA: I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
LENA: I'll go with you.
LENA: It's OK! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
LENA: No, I didn't get the chance.
LENA: No, not at all. No problem.
LENA: No, you said I was a good person...
LENA: No. Maya Angelou.
LENA: Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.
LENA: Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?
LENA: Pardon?
LENA: Talk to who?
LENA: Thanks. So, you were saying...?
LENA: What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.
LENA: Yeah.
LENA: Yeah. That's all they have.
LENA: You seem like you want to tell me something.
LEO: Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
LEO: Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
LEO: Arrested? Come on! I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
LEO: Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.
LEO: Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago. Leo hands the ketchup back to Nana.
LEO: But she's an anti-Semite.
LEO: Give it to me.
LEO: Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.
LEO: Ha ha! How are you?
LEO: He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
LEO: Hello!
LEO: Hello, ,hello.
LEO: Hello.
LEO: Helloooo!
LEO: How's your mom and dad?
LEO: I just talked to Dr. Denvro's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
LEO: I love these nuts.
LEO: I said it once.
LEO: I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
LEO: I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
LEO: I'll do it.
LEO: If anyone betrays me, I never forget.
LEO: Jerry!
LEO: Jerry! Hello!
LEO: Jerry, are you listening to this?
LEO: Jerry, hello!
LEO: Jerry, will you give me the bottle?
LEO: Jerry, you ratted me out?!
LEO: Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside - so he'll completely revamp that operation, you understand? He'll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. It's more money. So, that's your cousin.
LEO: Jerry.
LEO: Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Answer that damn phone!
LEO: Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.
LEO: Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
LEO: Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic Squeeze containers?
LEO: Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two. Jerry is staring at Leo, with an expression of suspicion.
LEO: Move back with Lydia?
LEO: No more nuts. Awrghh.....
LEO: No, for the walking tours.
LEO: Nobody got a gun to your head!
LEO: Oh, they don't care. We all do it.
LEO: Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
LEO: One second...
LEO: Senior citizens. No big deal.
LEO: So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
LEO: That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
LEO: They said they were sending an Asian woman.
LEO: Well, I hope you sent him a check.
LEO: What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
LEO: What fifty dollars?
LEO: What're you doing here?
LEO: What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
LEO: What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! But I'm not.
LEO: What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
LEO: Why didn't ya say hello?
LEO: Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
LEO: Yeah, me too. Nana enters with a bottle of ketchup.
LEO: You know how hard it was for me to get thjat appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
LEO: You know where I got this? I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
LEO: You know where I just came from?
LEO: You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
LEO: You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
LEO: You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
LEO: You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
LEO: You still say hello.
LEO: You walked out without paying.
LESLIE: And?
LESLIE: Come on! Let's go!

LISI: 84th street, right off Riverside Park.
LISI: 9:30.

LISI: So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?
LISI: Then may I say something... without being interrupted? Lisi is in another room with the door closed. Jerry stands in the hallway and is talking to her through the door.
LISI: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh... Now Jerry is sitting on the couch and Lisi is pacing behind him.
LISI: Well, I should probably--
LISI: What you were thinking.

LLOYD: Anybody see Elaine today?
LLOYD: Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
LLOYD: George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry. In addition to Lloyd, another customer is waiting to pay.
LLOYD: George. Lloyd sits beside George.
LLOYD: George?
LLOYD: Got any money? Jerry digs his wallet out of his pocket. He opens it and extracts a bill. He

LLOYD: Serenity now. Insanity later.
LLOYD: She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.

LLOYD: Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
LLOYD: You alright? Elaine stretches her back and neck, at the same time pushing her upperworks into
LLOYD: You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you
LLOYD: You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
LOIS: . . . Fine.
LOIS: . . . Why did you cheat in that race?
LOIS: About what?
LOIS: Have you designed any buildings in New York?

MACKENZIE: Huh, that's strange. It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?
MACKENZIE: Kind of like a... rustling.
MACKENZIE: Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. Well, take a bite. It's delicious. I insist.
MACKENZIE: No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place.
MACKENZIE: Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.
MACKENZIE: Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, phones ringing, people running in and out. Did you hear something?
MACKENZIE: You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?
MAESTRO: Ah, Kramer.
MAESTRO: Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.
MAESTRO: And I fell in love with this house.
MAESTRO: And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
MAESTRO: Beethoven's 7th.
MAESTRO: Ciao.
MAESTRO: Coincidental.
MAESTRO: Elaine? What a surprise.
MAESTRO: Fine.
MAESTRO: Good question. We'll need a few minutes.
MAESTRO: Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi.
MAESTRO: I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said
MAESTRO: I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.
MAESTRO: I told you, it's paradise.
MAESTRO: I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.
MAESTRO: I, uh, think I'll get some air.
MAESTRO: It is my very great pleasure.
MAESTRO: It's booked solid!
MAESTRO: It's nothing.
MAESTRO: Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess.
MAESTRO: Nor should you.
MAESTRO: Oh I suppose it's OK for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.
MAESTRO: Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.
MAESTRO: Oh yeah?
MAESTRO: Oh!
MAESTRO: Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.
MAESTRO: Oh. Love it when that happeneds.
MAESTRO: Ohh, I love this piece.
MAESTRO: Ohh, my pants. It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.
MAESTRO: Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!
MAESTRO: Ohh.. Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..
MAESTRO: The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.
MAESTRO: Unfortunately those photographs are at home.
MAESTRO: Well Hello. And who might you be?
MAESTRO: Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.
MAESTRO: Well, ya know I am a conductor.
MAESTRO: You didn't find one, did you?
MAESTRO: You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
MAESTRO: You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.
MAID: All done.
MAID: Is this mine?
MALE WORKER: Elaine! Where're you going? It's Walter's last day. We have to celebrate.
MALE WORKER: I think it's nice.
MALE WORKER: It's not happening. They all start to leave disappointed.
MALE WORKER: This is other-Walter, from returns. Other-Walter enters followed by more co-workers.
MALE WORKER: Turkey sandwich.
MALE WORKER: You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well cake.
MAN BEHIND THE DOOR: Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back!
MAN BEHIND THE DOOR: Hey, Kramer! I saw you going there! I'm not leaving until I get the jacket. Open up Kramer!
MAN IN AUDIENCE: I have cancer!
MAN IN CAR: Clean that up!

MAN: Although this may seem like a sad even, it should not be a day of mourning.. for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world - a simpler world - with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony.. Oh, how she loved that
MAN: Are you going to eat thoise fries?

MAN: Do I have to dial a one first? Elaine nods and the man crumples up her number.
MAN: Eat hickory!! The man swings the cane at George's head, mercifully the scene changes to Jerry,
MAN: Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.
MAN: Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
MAN: Expira te afuera.
MAN: Front desk...?
MAN: George?
MAN: Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had. At Jerry's apartment.

MAN: Nice day
MAN: No.
MAN: Now give me your code!
MAN: Now I got you! George jumps up from the scooter, picks it up and begins hauling it as fast as
MAN: Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.
MAN: Oh yeah. George leaps back on his scooter and floors it.
MAN: Oh, Excuse me.
MAN: Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--
MAN: Ohh.. You mean - one of these..

MAN: The machine won't open without the code!
MAN: The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the
MAN: There's a clock over there.
MAN: There's people down there! Hold on! They lift the floorboards to reveal Elaine and her group.
MAN: These clothes. The ones you're wearing. On Kramer's bus.
MAN: They just put out some more donuts.
MAN: Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..
MAN: Twix has too much coconut.
MAN: Ugh.. Ray.
MAN: Watch your step. Elaine collides with a litter bin which is outside her field of vision.
MAN: We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?
MAN: Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her.
MAN: Well, you know what opium is made from... Elaine: Poppies!

MAN: You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
MAN: You shot Death Blow?
MAN: You Steinfeld?
MAN: You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.
MAN: You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
MAN: You're soaking wet. Who are you?
MAN: You've done it again, C.K.!

MANDEL: I think , you've read, one too many, Billy Mumphrey stories. Good day Miss Benes.
MANDEL: So.. It was more a question of attitude than politics..
MANDEL: Three hours of massage time , twelve in-room movies including several adult features, five shoe shines and four hundred dolars worth of snacks. Not to mention the damage to the room.
MANDEL: Unbridled enthusiasm.
MANNY: Harold, Come on, hurry up!
MANNY: It looks worse.
MANNY: They're allowed to play until eleven o' clock.
MANYA: ..I had a pony.
MANYA: Can't dance?
MANYA: He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.
MANYA: Is that a joke?
MANYA: That's it! I've had enough!
MANYA: When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with that?
MANYA: Yeah, yeah..
MANYA: You! You said so!
MANYA: You're going?
MAR: Hi Jerry.
MARCELINO: 'Kay.
MARCELINO: Can, too!
MARCELINO: Even I am not above the policy.
MARCELINO: Hey, Kramer. Nice rooster. What's his name?
MARCELINO: Jerry! Tonight's fight-night. Where's my rooster?
MARCELINO: Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.
MARCELINO: Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks?
MARCELINO: Now we have a new deal.
MARCELINO: People seem to like the clowns.
MARCELINO: Shhh, not so loud.
MARCELINO: Sorry Kramer, can't help you.
MARCELINO: Sorry, no. It's store policy.
MARCELINO: Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event.
MARCELINO: Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway.
MARCELINO: When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.
MARCY: And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill.
MARCY: Are you close with your parents?
MARCY: Bloomingdale's.
MARCY: He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--
MARCY: How'd he look?
MARCY: I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.
MARCY: Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch.
MARCY: Oh, George.
MARCY: Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back.
MARCY: Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store.
MARCY: Okay.
MARCY: So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial.
MARCY: So what's she doing now?
MARCY: Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today.
MARCY: Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that?
MARCY: Why?
MARCY: Yada what?
MARCY: You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease in the hot tub.
MARGARET: Around three. I don't know.
MARGARET: Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?
MARGARET: He ended it.
MARGARET: Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.
MARGARET: Hello.
MARGARET: I liked him.
MARGARET: I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.
MARGARET: I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?
MARGARET: Just a few times.
MARGARET: Kiss me.
MARGARET: Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?
MARGARET: We used to go out.
MARGARET: Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.
MARGARET: What did Kramer say?
MARGARET: Who is staring?
MARGARET: Why not?
MARGARET: YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?
MARGARET: You know, Genderson. This is something big.
MARIAN: HELLO!

MARION: I can't. JERRY'S DOORWAY
MARION: I'm supposed to be atwork. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.
MARION: It's Bookman the library cop.
MARION: Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.
MARK: Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?
MARK: Hey how you doing?
MARK: I don't know, you manufacture it.
MARK: Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: Vandelay Industries.
MARK: Right.
MARK: You're in latex.
MARLA: Alright, then. Good night.
MARLA: Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
MARLA: Are you very fussy about your pants?
MARLA: Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
MARLA: Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
MARLA: Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
MARLA: George. Jerry, Stacey.
MARLA: Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
MARLA: I do. I'm ready.
MARLA: I don't know. He never came back.
MARLA: I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible. Horrible! All of you!
MARLA: I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
MARLA: I know how difficult this must have been for you.
MARLA: I should be going.
MARLA: I'll get some ice.
MARLA: It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
MARLA: Jerry.
MARLA: Let me tell you what I think.
MARLA: Let's go in the bedroom.
MARLA: Let's slow it down a little.
MARLA: Maybe I should get going.
MARLA: Never came back.
MARLA: No thanks.
MARLA: Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
MARLA: Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
MARLA: So they just leave?
MARLA: So, how was your trip to Berlin?
MARLA: So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
MARLA: The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
MARLA: Well because I'm a virgin.
MARLA: Well because...
MARLA: Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
MARLA: Well I wouldn't move in because...
MARLA: Well what if it was my apartment?
MARLA: Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
MARLA: Well, You know..
MARLA: What do you mean?
MARLA: Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
MARLA: Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
MARLA: Yes.
MARLA: Yes.
MARLA: You know, the apartment.
MARLA: You're okay with that, right?
MARLA: You, know my boyfriend went.
MARLENE: ..I saw your act.
MARLENE: ..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to work.
MARLENE: ..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and T-shirt. And I don't know, I was just in one of those moods - so I said to myself, Marlene, just do it, and I jumped in. And as I'm getting out, I feel all
MARLENE: Are you feeling weird?
MARLENE: Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.
MARLENE: Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.
MARLENE: I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.
MARLENE: I heard the material.
MARLENE: I know, I'm sorry.
MARLENE: Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back.
MARLENE: Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor.
MARLENE: Nothing really happened.
MARLENE: We just kissed a little. People kiss.
MARLENE: Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was.
MARLENE: Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.
MARLENE: Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff.
MARLENE: Well.. night.
MARLENE: You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.
MARRY: Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!
MARTIN: Good enough.
MARTIN: Ooooh, ahhhh,
MARTY: Another quilt? Huh?
MARTY: Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25
MARTY: Hey, forget it!
MARTY: I turned my house upside-down looking for this! It's all I have left of her.
MARTY: I'm sorry, it's not ready yet.
MARTY: It's done!
MARTY: Oh, about thirteen dollars.
MARTY: Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself.
MARTY: Well, I'm sorry.
MARTY: Well, see here, the chain is broken...it must have slipped in when I was, uh...
MARTY: Well, uh...maybe tomorrow. KRAMER: Maybe.
MARTY: What are you talkin' about?
MARTY: Who the hell are you? It's not your quilt.
MARY ANNE: And I'm still going to be here.
MARY ANNE: George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive.
MARY ANNE: I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?
MARY ANNE: I told you this city would eat you alive. At the muffin shop.
MARY ANNE: I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from?
MARY ANNE: Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie.
MARY ANNE: Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here.
MARY ANNE: Ooh. Jerry is in his bathroom shaving. He thinks. He tilts the mirror down.
MARY ANNE: Ouch. A month?
MARY ANNE: Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.
MARY ANNE: So I notice you don't have much of an accent.
MARY ANNE: Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.
MARY ANNE: Wow this is your office.
MARY ANNE: Yeah.
MARY ANNE: Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something. Mary Anne exits. George sniffs his armpit.
MARY: Hello, Jerry.
MARY: Hi Jeff. How are you? Mary and Jeff kiss hello.
MARY: Hi Pete. How you doing? Mary and Pete kiss hello.
MARY: Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?
MARY: Jerry?! Remember me?
MARY: Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!
MARY: Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and just get out of this building? Nobody wants you here. Nobody!
MARY: Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows.
MARY: Oh, that'd be great. The three of them exit together chatting happily, watched by a rueful
MARY: Thank you. Mary leans across and gives Jerry a quick kiss on the cheek, then makes
MARY: Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.
MARY: You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk to each other.
MAXWELL: Do you know how to use a mop wringer?
MAXWELL: Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money?
MAXWELL: Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here?
MAXWELL: Why don't you get in the car? Kramer hops in.
MAXWELL: You know where you're going?
MAXWELL: You wanna make some?
MECHANIC: DonÂ’t have one.

MERYL: Who is she? I want to know who she is.
MERYL: Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
MERYL: Yeah, me too. Love you.
MERYL: Yes, it is.
MERYL: You bring your own syrup?

MICHAEL: Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.
MICHAEL: The ocean? What'd you mean?

MICHAEL: Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...

MICKEY: All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?
MICKEY: Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late.
MICKEY: Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee. K I guess I screwed up!
MICKEY: Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here.
MICKEY: He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.

MICKEY: Karen and I are getting married.

MICKEY: Not Donna, it's Donner.
MICKEY: Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
MICKEY: Oh, thank you. It's 100
MICKEY: Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa!
MICKEY: So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?
MICKEY: So you can't get Corned Beef?
MICKEY: That was quick! Nice job, Santa!
MICKEY: That's it, it's go time!
MICKEY: That's not bad.
MICKEY: There is no break.
MICKEY: Watch it!
MICKEY: We'll look like idiots.

MICKEY: What does that mean?
MICKEY: What the hell does that mean?
MICKEY: Why not?
MICKEY: Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet.
MICKEY: Yeah, well I'm wearin' it.
MICKEY: Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?
MICKEY: You sure did. Big time.
MICKEY: You're a lightweight. Come on, honey.
MIKE: All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.
MIKE: I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
MIKE: Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.

MISS RHODE ISLAND: No, thanks. I'm watching my weight.
MISS RHODE ISLAND: Rhode Island.
MM: Hello.
MOLLIKA: He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.
MOLLIKA: Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.
MOLLIKA: Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs.
MOLLIKA: REally. ... You really look great.
MOLLIKA: What's that?
MOM: Hello .
MOM: Nice meeting you .
MOM: She's wonderful .
MOMICKEY: She doesn't speak English .
MONA: I didn't think I'd come.
MONA: Oh, Kramer!
MONA: Pleasure to meet you.
MONA: Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.
MONICA: And coffee?
MONICA: Are you looking for George?
MONICA: But why?
MONICA: Food? What food?
MONICA: George left.
MONICA: George!
MONICA: George, open up.
MONICA: George?
MONICA: Good luck.
MONICA: He got her number off an AIDS walk list?
MONICA: How did you do?
MONICA: How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.
MONICA: How did you get there?
MONICA: I need to get something.
MONICA: Is that the test?
MONICA: Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.
MONICA: Thanks. I hope you did do a lot better this time.
MONICA: The door is locked.
MONICA: Time's up George.
MONICA: Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.
MONICA: Well?
MONICA: What happened to the test?
MONICA: What?
MONICA: Where did you get food?
MONICA: Where did you get the coffee?
MONICA: Where's the test?
MONICA: Why didn't you go out the door?
MONICA: You are a fascinating man, George Costanza.
MONICA: You climbed out the window?
MONTAGE: Lisi is sitting at her couch while Jerry paces behind her.
MORGAN: Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card?
MORGAN: Fine. I'll be back after my massage.
MORGAN: Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass?
MORGAN: I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.
MORGAN: I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off.
MORGAN: I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?
MORGAN: I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low.
MORGAN: Is that right?
MORGAN: Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.
MORGAN: Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for me to sign.
MORGAN: No sir, George never gave it to me.
MORGAN: Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card?
MORGAN: Why?
MORGAN: Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch.
MORTY: . . . give you fish.
MORTY: ..You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
MORTY: 19.45$ ?
MORTY: Aah! The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that'it for them.
MORTY: Ah! It's Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
MORTY: Ah, there he is!
MORTY: Aha!
MORTY: Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
MORTY: All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . . Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
MORTY: All right, all right.
MORTY: All right, Leo.
MORTY: All right. Make it 20 bucks.
MORTY: All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
MORTY: And every morning I eat a plum.
MORTY: And it's always about Jeffrey, right?
MORTY: And smart! Like a computer!
MORTY: Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
MORTY: Are you getting that?
MORTY: Are you kidding? They built the lake.
MORTY: Are you ready for dessert?
MORTY: Astronaut?
MORTY: Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
MORTY: Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
MORTY: because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
MORTY: Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
MORTY: Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
MORTY: Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
MORTY: But it comes on 11:30.
MORTY: But there are no stamps on these.
MORTY: Bye, Jer.
MORTY: Bye, Mr. Kramer.
MORTY: Come on. That's enough, sit down!
MORTY: D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund For fifty-three years...
MORTY: Depends on the firm.
MORTY: Did you have a coke or what?
MORTY: Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to Over fifty-three years?
MORTY: Doesn't sound like you're friends to me. If you were friends you'd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
MORTY: Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
MORTY: Evening, Mr. Kramer!
MORTY: First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on? There's a knock at the door.
MORTY: From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn't like.
MORTY: George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
MORTY: Get out of here.
MORTY: Give me the receipt.
MORTY: Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?
MORTY: Good. OK What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
MORTY: Got lucky.
MORTY: He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number.
MORTY: He gave him the pen.
MORTY: He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
MORTY: He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
MORTY: He pretends he bumped into her!
MORTY: He'll send them express.
MORTY: He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
MORTY: He's wearing one.
MORTY: Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
MORTY: Hello Elaine
MORTY: Hello Jack.
MORTY: Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
MORTY: Hello.
MORTY: Hello.
MORTY: Hello?
MORTY: Here, I got it.
MORTY: Hey give 'em our best though.
MORTY: Hey guys . Jerry . Kramer
MORTY: Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
MORTY: Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
MORTY: Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
MORTY: Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
MORTY: Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut. Helen; Jerry, are you sure this all right?
MORTY: Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.

MORTY: Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
MORTY: Hey, Mr. Kramer!
MORTY: Hey, Mr. Kramer.
MORTY: Hey, that's some big job.
MORTY: Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
MORTY: Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
MORTY: His pen.
MORTY: How about Loni Anderson?
MORTY: How come he gets to leave?
MORTY: How could you not get the insurance?
MORTY: How long they been doing this?
MORTY: How the hell do you work this thing?
MORTY: How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
MORTY: How're your folks?
MORTY: I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
MORTY: I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
MORTY: I don't know her either. She makes me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
MORTY: I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.
MORTY: I don't see envelopes!
MORTY: I don't want it!
MORTY: I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where I got it.
MORTY: I got a sport jacket.
MORTY: I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
MORTY: I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
MORTY: I knew it, I told ya! HELEN: Uncle Leo said.
MORTY: I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
MORTY: I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
MORTY: I thought you forgot about me.
MORTY: I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
MORTY: I wouldn't give him the satiusfaction.
MORTY: I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
MORTY: I'll get it!
MORTY: I'll pay.
MORTY: I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
MORTY: I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
MORTY: I'm gonna explain what boxes.
MORTY: I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there. DR. DEMBROW: Why, I don't see how something like that could have happened.
MORTY: I'm not talking loud!
MORTY: I'm ready
MORTY: I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
MORTY: I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
MORTY: I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
MORTY: It's Morty
MORTY: It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
MORTY: Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
MORTY: Jack have some spong cake.
MORTY: Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
MORTY: Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
MORTY: Jerry please,
MORTY: Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
MORTY: Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
MORTY: Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
MORTY: Jerry, you ever watch that?
MORTY: Just a second.
MORTY: Leave all my stuff here?
MORTY: Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
MORTY: Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
MORTY: Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
MORTY: Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. What do they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. My back was fine.
MORTY: Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
MORTY: Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
MORTY: Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
MORTY: Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
MORTY: Maybe you should see a doctor.
MORTY: No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
MORTY: No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
MORTY: No, no put it away . . .
MORTY: No, we just came for the funeral. `
MORTY: Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
MORTY: Nobody uses it.
MORTY: None
MORTY: Nothing nothing.
MORTY: Nothing. Batteries. Well, they wear out so quick.
MORTY: Oh come on!
MORTY: Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
MORTY: Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
MORTY: Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
MORTY: Oh! I forgot all about it.
MORTY: Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
MORTY: Oh, for God's sakes!
MORTY: Oh, yeah, I'd be lying on the X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
MORTY: Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.
MORTY: Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
MORTY: Ok, bye. HELEN & AARON: Bye.
MORTY: One day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
MORTY: Plum...
MORTY: Plus the insurance.
MORTY: Quone's not a word...
MORTY: Raincoats.
MORTY: Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
MORTY: Send them tomorrow.
MORTY: She's got priors.
MORTY: Should I pick up?
MORTY: Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three
MORTY: Slept on the job?
MORTY: So ask Elaine there for the number.
MORTY: So bring a snack-pack.
MORTY: So look.
MORTY: So much the better.
MORTY: So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
MORTY: So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?
MORTY: So, how did she find out?
MORTY: So, how'd you do?
MORTY: So, what are you? Afraid of her?
MORTY: So, what took you so long?
MORTY: So, when do I get to see the doctor? NURSE: He'll be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed.
MORTY: So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
MORTY: Somebody had a coke.
MORTY: Sorbonne? Oh, hey. That's in Paris.
MORTY: Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
MORTY: Stop it.
MORTY: Tell him to eat a plum.
MORTY: Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that!
MORTY: Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (The Van Buren Boys come out of the alley, George holds up his hand in a stop gesture - then takes off running down the street, screaming. The Van Buren Boys
MORTY: That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
MORTY: That's right. They went like hotcakes.
MORTY: That's the second time you said personal favor. Why do you keep saying that?
MORTY: That's what you say.
MORTY: Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
MORTY: They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
MORTY: They stole my wallet.
MORTY: They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. ItÂ’s gone.
MORTY: They're good around the house and they're good for outside.

MORTY: Twice! And Dembrowdoesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
MORTY: We can't stand them.
MORTY: We got plenty of time.
MORTY: We're going with a select charter group.
MORTY: Welcome to Florida!
MORTY: Well we do.
MORTY: Well what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. uh, look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel .
MORTY: Well, go up to the office.
MORTY: Well, he's not getting away with this!
MORTY: Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
MORTY: Well, she can't be too mad-- she's still coming to the wedding.
MORTY: Well, we just bought a new place down there.
MORTY: What about her?
MORTY: What are you kidding me?
MORTY: What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
MORTY: What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
MORTY: What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
MORTY: What are you talking? We use it.
MORTY: What are you worried about?
MORTY: What did you have? You had the minute steak?
MORTY: What did you say?
MORTY: What do you want?
MORTY: What for? LEO: What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.

MORTY: Where do you come off with this crap?
MORTY: While I was in getting X-Rayed. DR. DEMBROW: All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but would you like me to look over these X-Rays?
MORTY: Who are you?
MORTY: Who is it?
MORTY: Why are you whispering?
MORTY: Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
MORTY: Why should I be comfortable?
MORTY: Why the hell didn't you tell us?
MORTY: Why would he mind? We're his parents. Elaine walks in picking her teeth, she didn't expect to see Jerry's parents.
MORTY: Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson?
MORTY: Wrap it up, we'll take it home. George walks in with his parents.
MORTY: Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular.
MORTY: yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
MORTY: Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
MORTY: Yeah, yeah, you make money.
MORTY: You didn't give it to him.
MORTY: You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
MORTY: You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare.
MORTY: You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
MORTY: You got enough here for a life sentence.
MORTY: You gotta deal.
MORTY: You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
MORTY: You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.

NARRATOR: It's a story about life. And love. And becoming a woman. ``Rochelle Rochelle'', now playing at Paradise 2.
NARRATOR: The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece. A young woman's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
NED: All right, I'll try it on.
NED: Anyone who works here is a sap.
NED: Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive.
NED: I bet the beard itches doesn't it?
NED: I guess.
NED: I know it's not the same.
NED: I'm sorry Elaine. The shirt's too fancy.
NED: Kramer, I've got some literature in my car that will change your whole way of thinking.
NED: Out of the question.
NED: So when you get a rash all over your face in January do you think Coleman's will be there with a medical plan?
NED: Yeah, we had a good run.
NED: Yeah, well, we still got China, and Cuba,
NED: Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They named names.
NED: Yes, as a matter of fact I am.
NED: You got me blacklisted from Hop Sing's?

NEWMAN AND KRAMER: Ohhh!
NEWMAN AND KRAMER: Sucker..
NEWMAN AND KRAMER: Woah.
NEWMAN:  No. Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
NEWMAN: ...But I have made a decision. We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
NEWMAN: ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no Matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
NEWMAN: ???????
NEWMAN: A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
NEWMAN: A piece of crap.
NEWMAN: Aahh! You're great ,It's great , It's so great to see a show that's about something. Kramer climbs into a cab
NEWMAN: After you.
NEWMAN: Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
NEWMAN: Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
NEWMAN: Ahaha!
NEWMAN: Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
NEWMAN: Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
NEWMAN: All right , all right . I'll help you but I will except something in return .
NEWMAN: All right . Then let me ask you this . Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your
NEWMAN: All right! All right. I wonÂ’t say anything.
NEWMAN: All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
NEWMAN: All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information. In the car service car.
NEWMAN: All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
NEWMAN: All right, give me the rope.
NEWMAN: All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass. Mr. Lippman: What is going on here?
NEWMAN: All right. Bark.
NEWMAN: All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
NEWMAN: Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
NEWMAN: Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
NEWMAN: Alright, let's begin. Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single
NEWMAN: Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
NEWMAN: Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
NEWMAN: Alright, well be back... jack!
NEWMAN: Alright, who's first?
NEWMAN: An alliance?
NEWMAN: And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie .
NEWMAN: And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside. Kramer: Uh, yeah.
NEWMAN: And why was that? Kramer: Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
NEWMAN: And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
NEWMAN: And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance
NEWMAN: Anyway.
NEWMAN: Are you married right now?
NEWMAN: As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
NEWMAN: Aww..
NEWMAN: Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas
NEWMAN: Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
NEWMAN: Bark.
NEWMAN: Beauty.. and brains.
NEWMAN: Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
NEWMAN: Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it
NEWMAN: Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! The dream is dead.
NEWMAN: Boy, thatÂ’s the full size.
NEWMAN: Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
NEWMAN: But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
NEWMAN: But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
NEWMAN: But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
NEWMAN: But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow,
NEWMAN: Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer. The waitress brings a roasted turkey out on a tray. Newman hallucinates
NEWMAN: Butter?
NEWMAN: Can I have a bite?
NEWMAN: Can I have a sip ?
NEWMAN: Can I use your bathroom?
NEWMAN: Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
NEWMAN: Can't we worry about them later?
NEWMAN: Care for some lemonade?
NEWMAN: Clean ? Hardly . This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance .
NEWMAN: Come on Kramer! The door opens to reveal Kramer midway through a shave, holding a
NEWMAN: Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
NEWMAN: Cool?
NEWMAN: Coy? I'm not being coy.
NEWMAN: Crazy Joe Davola? George: Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
NEWMAN: Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
NEWMAN: Damn!
NEWMAN: Damn! Frustrated, he sits back. He notices a framed photograph of his mother.
NEWMAN: Deh!
NEWMAN: Did I?
NEWMAN: Do not bend. Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well.
NEWMAN: Do we have a deal ?
NEWMAN: Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
NEWMAN: Does yours?
NEWMAN: Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
NEWMAN: Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
NEWMAN: El Paso!
NEWMAN: Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got
NEWMAN: Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
NEWMAN: Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform.
NEWMAN: Excellent. Excellent.
NEWMAN: Excuse me Miss Weaver , OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
NEWMAN: Five dollars. He offered us five dollars.
NEWMAN: Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
NEWMAN: For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
NEWMAN: Fourty-nine.
NEWMAN: Frequently .
NEWMAN: From me!
NEWMAN: Gangway!
NEWMAN: George?
NEWMAN: Gladly.
NEWMAN: Go girl!
NEWMAN: Good night.
NEWMAN: Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel Newman leaves laughing. Jerry looks confused.
NEWMAN: ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
NEWMAN: He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
NEWMAN: He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
NEWMAN: He's out.
NEWMAN: He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
NEWMAN: Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
NEWMAN: Hello . What 's this ?
NEWMAN: Hello Elaine. Where are they?
NEWMAN: Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry .
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. So, any news?
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
NEWMAN: Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
NEWMAN: HELP!
NEWMAN: Help! Help!
NEWMAN: Here. Hold this.
NEWMAN: Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
NEWMAN: Hey!! Help me! The show ends with a freeze frame of Newman on the bike, and a
NEWMAN: Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
NEWMAN: Hey, hey...
NEWMAN: Hey, what is that up that tree?
NEWMAN: Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
NEWMAN: Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
NEWMAN: Hi Babs
NEWMAN: Hilarious.
NEWMAN: Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb. At George's office.
NEWMAN: How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
NEWMAN: I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route . Well today I won't be going on my mail route ! Will I . Perhaps tomorrow .
NEWMAN: I called in sick . I don't work in the rain .
NEWMAN: I can't believe I'm being evicted.
NEWMAN: I can't. I'm goin' to the movies.
NEWMAN: I canÂ’t eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
NEWMAN: I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
NEWMAN: I did invite you.. Your invitation must've.. gotten lost in the mail.
NEWMAN: I didn't get my transfer.
NEWMAN: I don't know, they're deranged. Kramer and Newman sit on Jerry's couch. Kramer has TV Guide, Newman
NEWMAN: I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
NEWMAN: I don't like it.
NEWMAN: I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
NEWMAN: I don't wanna.
NEWMAN: I donÂ’t care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
NEWMAN: I find you extremely ugly.
NEWMAN: I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
NEWMAN: I guess.
NEWMAN: I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
NEWMAN: I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. If you don't mind?
NEWMAN: I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
NEWMAN: I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
NEWMAN: I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
NEWMAN: I knew you'd back out.
NEWMAN: I know exactly how he feels . Pleasure doing business with you . Do come again . Ha, ha, ha, ha.
NEWMAN: I like the thick tape. Newman puts dental floss on the dashboard. Jerry looks disgusted.
NEWMAN: I loathe you.
NEWMAN: I love broccoli, its good for you.
NEWMAN: I need that mail, where is it?!
NEWMAN: I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
NEWMAN: I swear.
NEWMAN: I think he stealing our rickshaw!
NEWMAN: I told you he was a risk.
NEWMAN: I use dental tape.
NEWMAN: I usually do. See ya.
NEWMAN: I wanna learn. I want to know why.
NEWMAN: I was never that big on creeds .
NEWMAN: I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
NEWMAN: I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
NEWMAN: I'm a United States postal worker.
NEWMAN: I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
NEWMAN: I'm on the roof!
NEWMAN: I'm sorry I missed that.
NEWMAN: I've should've gone in with him.
NEWMAN: If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence. Newman goes to the back room with the muffin stumps and sets down a cooler and an empty glass. From the cooler he takes out 4 bottles of milk and sets them down.
NEWMAN: If we put our three heads together we should come up with something. --
NEWMAN: If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
NEWMAN: Is this or is this not your signature ?
NEWMAN: It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clam.
NEWMAN: It was a cinch. Where are you going?
NEWMAN: It was a real melee.
NEWMAN: It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
NEWMAN: It was disgusting.
NEWMAN: It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
NEWMAN: It'll be my pleasure. Kramer puts the photograph to the envelope. Newman and Kramer laughs and Newman leaves.
NEWMAN: It's entirely possible.
NEWMAN: It's getting cold, it's getting cold.
NEWMAN: It's Newman.
NEWMAN: It's okay. A little crooked.
NEWMAN: It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld . Pretty ....... Hot .
NEWMAN: It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
NEWMAN: It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
NEWMAN: It's Thursday.
NEWMAN: IÂ’ll bring him up to date.
NEWMAN: Jerry , Jerry , Jerry , Jerry , Jerry , Jerry , Jerry , Jerry , Jerry .
NEWMAN: Jerry!
NEWMAN: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
NEWMAN: Jerry, George. So, did you ask him about the records?
NEWMAN: Jerry, you better stop her or IÂ’ll tell.
NEWMAN: Jerry? Jerry nods reluctantly.
NEWMAN: Just one bite?
NEWMAN: Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
NEWMAN: Kramer bit me!
NEWMAN: Kramer you might as well run along . Jerry might be a while . Suspicion of mail fraud .
NEWMAN: Kramer!
NEWMAN: Kramer! I'm with people.
NEWMAN: Kramer? Kramer? There you are.
NEWMAN: Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
NEWMAN: Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. you know. I rip of the label. I can hardly tell the difference.
NEWMAN: laughs
NEWMAN: Let the collecting begin! They embrace joyfully.
NEWMAN: Let's go. Let's go. Move!
NEWMAN: Like Silkwood.
NEWMAN: Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
NEWMAN: Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! All right, now here's the lowdown.
NEWMAN: Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
NEWMAN: Make us!
NEWMAN: Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
NEWMAN: Minding my own business.
NEWMAN: Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one
NEWMAN: My toilet's clogged.
NEWMAN: Name, please.
NEWMAN: Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
NEWMAN: Nice place you got here Kramer a man can really get some thinking done.
NEWMAN: No reason.
NEWMAN: No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
NEWMAN: No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
NEWMAN: No, no I don't like it.
NEWMAN: No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in
NEWMAN: No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
NEWMAN: No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost. Kramer boosting Newman into the tree.
NEWMAN: No.
NEWMAN: No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
NEWMAN: No. Newman tries again as Jerry goes to his couch. Newman follows behind Jerry closely. Newman puts the
NEWMAN: Not going to play ball . Huh all right . Admit it that stereo was all ready busted .
NEWMAN: Not really.
NEWMAN: Not so fast pretty boy . There is more to this sorted little affair .
NEWMAN: Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
NEWMAN: Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
NEWMAN: Number 67, right here, right here!
NEWMAN: Of course. Obviously.
NEWMAN: Of course. Take your time. I be here.
NEWMAN: Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make
NEWMAN: Oh well . Let me perfectly blunt . I don't care for you Costanza . You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just
NEWMAN: Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
NEWMAN: Oh, all the way up.
NEWMAN: Oh, can I watch a little? It's my favorite movie.
NEWMAN: Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
NEWMAN: Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
NEWMAN: Okay. Kramer: I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
NEWMAN: On my motherÂ’s life.
NEWMAN: Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
NEWMAN: One large jambalaya, please.
NEWMAN: Ooh, my cocoa! Newman leaps to his feet and heads for his kitchen.
NEWMAN: Oooh,
NEWMAN: Pair of bear claws, please. Jerry approaches Newman, but some women comes between and feels Jerry's shirt.
NEWMAN: Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
NEWMAN: Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
NEWMAN: Refund?
NEWMAN: Rusty.
NEWMAN: See'ya later.
NEWMAN: So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squaller.
NEWMAN: So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
NEWMAN: So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
NEWMAN: So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation? Elaine taking his coat and then throwing it on the floor.
NEWMAN: So, which one of us is gonna pull?
NEWMAN: Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
NEWMAN: Sometimes we don't get what we want.
NEWMAN: Sometimes...
NEWMAN: Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
NEWMAN: Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
NEWMAN: South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us mixed up with?
NEWMAN: Take it or leave it!? We got Al Jolson here, Al Jolson!!
NEWMAN: Take me! Take me!
NEWMAN: Ten cents!?
NEWMAN: Thank you. Jambalaya!
NEWMAN: That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
NEWMAN: That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
NEWMAN: That's right. Kramer: Now, what is this?
NEWMAN: That's where my missing soda is.
NEWMAN: The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
NEWMAN: The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
NEWMAN: The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
NEWMAN: The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
NEWMAN: The Pacific Northwest. Elaine with Jerry at his apartment.
NEWMAN: The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
NEWMAN: The smell. It's still with you, huh?
NEWMAN: There it is!
NEWMAN: There will be a small fine .
NEWMAN: There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
NEWMAN: They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
NEWMAN: They follow him like a cult.
NEWMAN: They're gonna beat me up!
NEWMAN: This isn't about my opening your mail?
NEWMAN: This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring .As does this one found in the same disturbing
NEWMAN: This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman! Kramer backs away then runs down the hall.
NEWMAN: Those records are worth more than five dollars!
NEWMAN: To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
NEWMAN: To prevent an ambush.
NEWMAN: Too many people go their mail! Close to 80
NEWMAN: Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
NEWMAN: Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
NEWMAN: Uh, you, uh, you better put something on. Jerry, at Joe Mayo's party with George.
NEWMAN: Uh-Huh.
NEWMAN: Uh..
NEWMAN: Uncle Leo ? This case is closed pending further evidence . Jerry . Kramer and Elaine at doctor's
NEWMAN: Vile weed!
NEWMAN: Waaaaahhhh! (Zach and the rickshaw collide. From back up on top of the street, Kramer tries to separate himself from the accident. He starts walking, then running away from the
NEWMAN: Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the
NEWMAN: Wallet.
NEWMAN: Wayne Knight
NEWMAN: We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
NEWMAN: We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?
NEWMAN: We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
NEWMAN: We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
NEWMAN: We have some questions we'd like you to answer .
NEWMAN: We made quite a haul.
NEWMAN: We'll pay anything. We've got the What about Jerry?
NEWMAN: We're practically to Monticello.
NEWMAN: We've got no one!
NEWMAN: Well for starters I want a calzone of my own .....
NEWMAN: Well that's a shame.
NEWMAN: Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
NEWMAN: Well, Elaine:, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
NEWMAN: Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
NEWMAN: Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
NEWMAN: Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
NEWMAN: Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
NEWMAN: Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
NEWMAN: Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
NEWMAN: Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
NEWMAN: Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
NEWMAN: Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
NEWMAN: Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
NEWMAN: What about a guest-host?
NEWMAN: What are you doing?
NEWMAN: What are you proposing?
NEWMAN: What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
NEWMAN: What do you think? Drive. Drive.
NEWMAN: What for, you got your own.
NEWMAN: What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
NEWMAN: What kind of dog did you say it was?
NEWMAN: What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
NEWMAN: What took you so long?
NEWMAN: What you need me in the car for?
NEWMAN: What's the catch?
NEWMAN: What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
NEWMAN: When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
NEWMAN: Who is it.
NEWMAN: Who made you the leader?
NEWMAN: Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?
NEWMAN: Why, because I use dental tape?
NEWMAN: Will that take care of ours too?
NEWMAN: Work ? It's raining .
NEWMAN: Wow, where did you get that?
NEWMAN: Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
NEWMAN: Yeah, but he's a fighter.
NEWMAN: Yeah, but I though-
NEWMAN: Yeah, I suppose.
NEWMAN: Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
NEWMAN: Yeah, me too.
NEWMAN: Yeah, yeah.
NEWMAN: Yeah.
NEWMAN: Yeah.
NEWMAN: Yeah. From you.
NEWMAN: Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
NEWMAN: Yep.
NEWMAN: Yes . It's called mail fraud . Oohhhh . How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld . The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out
NEWMAN: Yes thank you .
NEWMAN: Yes, a phone call!
NEWMAN: Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
NEWMAN: Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
NEWMAN: Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
NEWMAN: Yes, the banker!!!
NEWMAN: Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
NEWMAN: Yessss! In celebration he swigs from a bottle of soda.
NEWMAN: You are nothing but a piece of crap.
NEWMAN: You are?
NEWMAN: You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
NEWMAN: You certainly are in a bind .
NEWMAN: You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
NEWMAN: You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
NEWMAN: You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
NEWMAN: You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic . I would hate to see him when he's hungry .
NEWMAN: You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
NEWMAN: You know what I mean. Kramer: I was very upset that day.
NEWMAN: You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, Why? Are we really so different. For what is--
NEWMAN: You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
NEWMAN: You lookin' for someone?
NEWMAN: You might say that.
NEWMAN: You must be banker.
NEWMAN: You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say... Kramer: Yo-yo Ma!
NEWMAN: You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily cerified. WOMAN; I could listed to you talk about mail all day.
NEWMAN: You tried it?
NEWMAN: You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
NEWMAN: You were going to...
NEWMAN: You're gyppin' us!
NEWMAN: You're off your rocker.
NEWMAN: You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
NEWMAN: You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
NEWMAN: You?! You can't deliver mail!

PATRICE: And you didn't comment on the chop sticks.
PATRICE: Don't give me cliches. I have a right to know. What did I do wrong?
PATRICE: Don't LIE George.
PATRICE: Everyone in my family's creative. And even though I'm working as an accountant now I'd really like to eventually live exclusively on my pappe-ay mache-ay hats
PATRICE: George thinks I'm pretentious.
PATRICE: I know what you said. You can't change that.
PATRICE: I prefer to go alone. How much do I owe?
PATRICE: I want the truth.
PATRICE: It's my creative outlet. One of my passions.
PATRICE: Keep goin'.
PATRICE: No, I asked for the truth. Thank you for being so honest.
PATRICE: Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies.

PATTY: Ooh, that was good.
PATTY: Sarcastically) Uh huh.
PATTY: So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish place La Caridad on Saturday.
PATTY: Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.
PATTY: What is this?
PATTY: Yes, you are, liar.
PATTY: You know... I've never seen you mad.
PATTY: You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open.

PENNY: A contest.
PENNY: A, uh -
PENNY: I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.
PENNY: It was horrible, horrible!
PENNY: It's rather difficult to talk about.
PENNY: Oh please, I can't.
PENNY: The four of them made a wager to see if they could -
PENNY: To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.
PENNY: Well, I became aware of a -
PENNY: Yes.
PENSKY: Costanza? Arthur Pensky.
PENSKY: Damn this city. Pensky leaves.
PENSKY: Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing
PENSKY: He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. Looks like you put a lot of work into this.
PENSKY: Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?
PENSKY: Where's Tuttle?
PENSKY: Yes.
PENSKY: You are aware... buzz
PEOPLE AT TABLE: What? What is she talking about? What did she say?
PERRY: It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look. Jerry hands the catalog to George.
PETE: Hey, let's go get some coffee.
PETER: Seinfeld.....
PETERMAN: ...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit
PETERMAN: 2.. CBS..
PETERMAN: 3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
PETERMAN: Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
PETERMAN: Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
PETERMAN: All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
PETERMAN: All right, Elaine.
PETERMAN: All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
PETERMAN: And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
PETERMAN: Are you an assassin?
PETERMAN: Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too.
PETERMAN: Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.
PETERMAN: But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend And therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in
PETERMAN: Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. And you will be at his side.
PETERMAN: Do they have a castle at Windsor?
PETERMAN: Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
PETERMAN: Doctor, how is she?
PETERMAN: Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
PETERMAN: Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
PETERMAN: Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
PETERMAN: Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
PETERMAN: Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
PETERMAN: Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
PETERMAN: Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
PETERMAN: Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
PETERMAN: Elaine.
PETERMAN: Elaine.
PETERMAN: For the love of God!
PETERMAN: Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this. Elaine leaves.
PETERMAN: George! New scene.
PETERMAN: George, give him your code!
PETERMAN: George, give me your ATM card!
PETERMAN: George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
PETERMAN: George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that! George pulls out his wallet, Peterman grabs the card, fits it into the slot and
PETERMAN: Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
PETERMAN: Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
PETERMAN: Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
PETERMAN: Have you been crying? Elaine: Yes, you see this woman, this manicurist,
PETERMAN: How much would you take for the whole lot?
PETERMAN: I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
PETERMAN: I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian
PETERMAN: I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
PETERMAN: I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
PETERMAN: I'd be happy to Elaine ... but I will have to see this hat.
PETERMAN: I'll give you half that.
PETERMAN: I'm afraid I can't take you.
PETERMAN: I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
PETERMAN: I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
PETERMAN: I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
PETERMAN: Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000. EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT
PETERMAN: It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
PETERMAN: It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
PETERMAN: It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door, The man grabs the card and slams it into the machine.
PETERMAN: It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
PETERMAN: J. Peterman. George: J. Crew.
PETERMAN: John O'Hurley
PETERMAN: Kramer, my friend, consider Elaine at your disposal.
PETERMAN: Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn..
PETERMAN: Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
PETERMAN: Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama. She looks off in George's direction.
PETERMAN: Momma! What are you trying to say? Mrs. Peterman: Bosco.
PETERMAN: Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
PETERMAN: My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, All right! Who's dancing? No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female
PETERMAN: Name your price, man!
PETERMAN: No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
PETERMAN: No Elaine, that was gibberish. So did you have any trouble finding the place?
PETERMAN: Nonsense! I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
PETERMAN: Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict,
PETERMAN: Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
PETERMAN: Oh no, that doesnÂ’t matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
PETERMAN: Oh! no right away , chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon.....I wish I was taller I'd like to see that complaint get rectified.
PETERMAN: Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 5:00 to clear out your
PETERMAN: Oh, good lord.
PETERMAN: Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry. Lubeck inspects the cake.
PETERMAN: Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it.
PETERMAN: Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop.
PETERMAN: One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly. It must have been an
PETERMAN: Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make
PETERMAN: Peterman, here.
PETERMAN: Shake off the dew, my friend.
PETERMAN: She's gone. Bosco? Peterman looks at George, who shrugs.
PETERMAN: So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
PETERMAN: So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
PETERMAN: Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they
PETERMAN: That inferno rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
PETERMAN: That irreverence , that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine , to my archives.
PETERMAN: That noise. that's the noise.
PETERMAN: That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
PETERMAN: That shirt. Where did you get it?
PETERMAN: That's my coat.
PETERMAN: That's NOT bad!
PETERMAN: That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
PETERMAN: That's the best way to get someplace you've never been. Elaine: yes, I suppose,
PETERMAN: The fire will eat up this entire block! They come upon an ATM vestibule.
PETERMAN: The horror...the horror.
PETERMAN: The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing!
PETERMAN: Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00. Ex; Oh, that's not too expensive.
PETERMAN: There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
PETERMAN: Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
PETERMAN: Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent dribble! This is a total redo and I'm assuming I need it right away.
PETERMAN: Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this. Mr. Peterman shows Elaine the tape of her waltzing around the room eating the cake.
PETERMAN: Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
PETERMAN: We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
PETERMAN: Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
PETERMAN: well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
PETERMAN: Well, it started out nicely: I'm returning some pants. A very identifiable problem.. I set of down a train tunnel... But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
PETERMAN: Well, that's pretty exciting. Let's put that in the book.
PETERMAN: Well, where are they?
PETERMAN: What is it?
PETERMAN: Yes, I'm J. Peterman.
PETERMAN: You do?
PETERMAN: You don't say.
PETERMAN: You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
PETERMAN: You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
PETERMAN: You must be Jerry Seinfeld.
PETERMAN: You want to know something? I no longer need them!
PETERMAN: You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
PHARMACIST: Actually, we have a case left. ELAINE: A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
PHARMACIST: Can I help you? ELAINE: Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
PHARMACIST: Did you say twenty?
PHARMACIST: Right. So, you're set with twenty-five.
PHARMACIST: Sixty.
PHARMACIST: Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them.
PHARMACIST: Ten?
PHARMACIST: Three.
PHIL: Ow!
PHILBIN: And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!
PHONE MAN: All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new number.
PHONE MAN: I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
PHONE MAN: Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic.

QUOTES AND SCENE SUMMARY:
QUOTES AND SCENE SUMMARY: Opening monologue
RABBI: Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.
RABBI: Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?
RABBI: Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?
RABBI: Don Ramsey?
RABBI: Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?
RABBI: Good evening. And how does this evening find you?
RABBI: Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.
RABBI: He owns a flower store. Very successful.
RABBI: How wonderful.
RABBI: I hope she's feeling better.
RABBI: I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.
RABBI: Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again. E: Yeah
RABBI: She came off as pretty desperate.
RABBI: She didn't tell you?
RABBI: Was that a problem for you? Elaine: Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you? Rabbi: Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.
RABBI: Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.
RABBI: Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .
RABBI: Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories
RABBI: Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.
RABBI: Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going to happen for you.
RABBI: You know my temple has many single functions.
RABBI: You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after
RABBI: You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.
RACHEL: Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
RACHEL: C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.

RACHEL: Don't you knock?
RACHEL: Good morning.
RACHEL: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
RACHEL: Huh?
RACHEL: I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
RACHEL: I suppose...
RACHEL: I'm gonna take a swim.
RACHEL: I've been doing a lot of thinking.
RACHEL: Jerry ...
RACHEL: Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
RACHEL: Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
RACHEL: Mm-hmm.
RACHEL: No.
RACHEL: Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry.
RACHEL: Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
RACHEL: Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
RACHEL: So where is this baby, anyway?
RACHEL: Strange man.
RACHEL: There's lobster in these eggs?
RACHEL: Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
RACHEL: Umm... This is so good.
RACHEL: We don't have any gum.
RACHEL: Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
RACHEL: Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
RACHEL: What'd you want anyway, George?
RACHEL: What?
RACHEL: Why not?
RACHEL: Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much. I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
RACHEL: Yeah, what's the big deal?
RACHEL: Yeah, you too.
RACHEL: Yes, I do, thanks.
RACHEL: You will?
RACHEL: You're right, I would have.

RAVA: And we have to get back to work.
RAVA: Demand. There's Ray.. late as usual.
RAVA: I admit nothing!
RAVA: Maybe I put it out on your face! It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us.
RAVA: Maybe you think we're in cahoots.
RAVA: My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere.
RAVA: No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? ..Well?! Well?!..
RAVA: No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.
RAVA: Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!
RAVA: Of course.
RAVA: Or maybe he's dead.
RAVA: Ray, would you give me a hand?
RAVA: So you think he stole it?!
RAVA: That's Ray.
RAVA: That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!
RAVA: The water is boiling. Are you having tea?
RAVA: Was Jerry?
RAVA: Well, if they don't let you be my editor on this book, I'll go to another publisher. It's that simple.
RAVA: Why should I be?
RAVA: Yes, that's all, a coincidence!
RAVA: You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.
RAVA: Your notes are very insightful.
RAY: Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
RAY: Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the soul.
RAY: And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
RAY: Are you saying I stole your statue?
RAY: Are you talking to me?
RAY: Bob.
RAY: But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
RAY: Do you take sugar?
RAY: For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop.
RAY: Give it back to whom?
RAY: Give it back?
RAY: Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.
RAY: Hey, hey, are you a cop?
RAY: Hey..
RAY: I can't believe what I'm hearing.
RAY: I hope you think about what you've done here today.. and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
RAY: I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
RAY: I said, are you talking to me?
RAY: I think you have me confused with somebody else.
RAY: I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
RAY: I'm not getting this.
RAY: I'm talking about the statue.
RAY: I've got to get going. I have a class.
RAY: If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
RAY: Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
RAY: It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
RAY: Lemon?
RAY: Look at this.
RAY: Murder?!
RAY: Oh, how about dinner?
RAY: Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into?
RAY: Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
RAY: Police?
RAY: Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
RAY: She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!
RAY: The pastries!
RAY: Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
RAY: Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty.
RAY: What are you saying?
RAY: What are you talking about?
RAY: What did you say?
RAY: What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?
RAY: What's going on here?
RAY: Who is this?
RAY: Yeah, I'm coming!
RAY: Yeah.
RAY: Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.
RAY: Yes?
RAY: You are starting to make me angry.
RAY: You want her.
RAY: You?
RAY: Your friend is crazy.
RAY: Your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.

SILVIO: Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?
SILVIO: I deal with him. George showing Jerry a newspaper ad.
SILVIO: I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
SILVIO: If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?
SILVIO: Jerry?
SILVIO: Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.
SILVIO: Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.

SILVIO: No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.
SILVIO: No, that's it. You're both out of the building!
SILVIO: OK, on your word he can stay.
SILVIO: Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?
SILVIO: That is your coat?
SILVIO: Then who?
SILVIO: What kind of a man would wear fur?
SILVIO: What's wrong?
SILVIO: Who's Joe Mayo?

SISTER ROBERTA: Good evening. I hope IÂ’m not disturbing you, but I found another toy I thought you might like.
SISTER ROBERTA: Him.
SISTER ROBERTA: I canÂ’t. IÂ’m sorry. ItÂ’s a beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something else.
SISTER ROBERTA: IÂ’m Sister Roberta.
SISTER ROBERTA: May I help you?
SISTER ROBERTA: Mine. At JerryÂ’s apartment.
SISTER ROBERTA: Oh are you? ThatÂ’s wonderful. Well good luck to you.

SLIPPERY PETE: I thought we were stealing it.
SLIPPERY PETE: It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.
SLIPPERY PETE: Mm-hmm.
SLIPPERY PETE: So do you. George makes it across just as a huge truck comes barreling down the street. George tries to get the Frogger onto the sidewalk, but can't. He futilely sticks his hand out trying to stop the truck which honks. George jumps out of the truck's way and onto the sidewalk as the Frogger is smashed.
SLIPPERY PETE: That was my mail-order bride.
SLIPPERY PETE: The batteries are fine. We've got...oh, god. only 3 minutes left.
SLIPPERY PETE: We're stealing this thing, right?
SLIPPERY PETE: Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can I at least steal a battery?
SLIPPERY PETE: What's that?
SLIPPERY PETE: Where are all the pizza ovens?
SLIPPERY PETE: You think you can handle that, numb nuts?

STEIN: Nothing.
STEIN: So what are you saying?
STEIN: Yes George, come in ,come in. You know George I've been your biggest supporter around here
STEIN: Yes it is. Well lets see what I have today. Darn it It's ham & Cheese again and she forgot the fancy mustard. I told her I like
STEINBRENNER: ???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear.
STEINBRENNER: A bomb in the building, oh, m'god. Quick, everyone under the desk.
STEINBRENNER: A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.
STEINBRENNER: A lot more work you know.
STEINBRENNER: All right George, you can handle that.
STEINBRENNER: Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies.
STEINBRENNER: Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more desks. Just Lucite tables and four leSTEINBRENNER.
STEINBRENNER: Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.
STEINBRENNER: Costanza what the hell are you doing?
STEINBRENNER: Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excus mois? Have you seen Costanza?
STEINBRENNER: Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing with you. All right boys send it in
STEINBRENNER: Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...
STEINBRENNER: He had one little problem though.
STEINBRENNER: He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.
STEINBRENNER: Hello are you the bomber?
STEINBRENNER: Hey you kids know tunes; see if this song rinSTEINBRENNER a bell, Heartbreaker , . . .
STEINBRENNER: How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real
STEINBRENNER: I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.
STEINBRENNER: I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey.
STEINBRENNER: Just let me ask you something. Is it February or  February? Because I prefer Febuary and what is this ru?
STEINBRENNER: Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it.
STEINBRENNER: Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve.
STEINBRENNER: Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening
STEINBRENNER: Stop it George, he's out, you're in.
STEINBRENNER: Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing.
STEINBRENNER: That's what they call me.
STEINBRENNER: Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. She's a heart breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh . . .very catchy. You know what? I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh?
STEINBRENNER: Well what do you want instead?
STEINBRENNER: Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something.
STEINBRENNER: What is it with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half hours. Should I go? No way Jack! , I'll tell you that.
STEINBRENNER: What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?
STEINBRENNER: When someone's unstable, you don't stir the fat, George! You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous.
STEINBRENNER: Yes George, I did. Come in, come in. George, the wordaround the office is that you're a Communist.
STEINBRENNER: Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit.
STEINBRENNER: Yes, George, please, come in, come in.
STEINBRENNER: Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?
STEINBRENNER: Yes, yes, come in.
STEINBRENNER: You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job.
STEINBRENNER: You could be invaluable to this franchise. George, there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look at;
STEINBRENNER: You don't want them, then goodbye.
STEINBRENNER: You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization.
STEINBRENNER: You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb ahead of time.
STELLA: Hello.
STELLA: Humm... We saw you on The Tonight Show last week.
STELLA: Morty are you nervous?

STEVE: What're you doing down here?
STEVE: What's the plan?
STEVE: Yeah, so?
STEVE: You think so?
STEVEN: Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher.
STEVEN: I don't know.. I made it up. I'm never gonna get this thing.
STEVEN: I think I'd really like to be a city planner. Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a whole city?
STEVEN: I want my scholarship back, so I can be a city planner.
STEVEN: I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..
STEVEN: Nastercoff?
STEVEN: So, Mister Costanza, did you get my scholarship back?
STEVEN: State champs.
STEVEN: Thank you.
STEVEN: Thank you.
STEVEN: That's not the sign.
STEVEN: These are my new friends - The Van Buren Boys. MEMBER 1: He became so disillusioned, he had to join us.
STEVEN: Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler?
STEVEN: Why'd you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza?
STEWARDESS: Could I take that box for you?
STEWARDESS: I'm afraid not.
STEWARDESS: No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.
STEWARDESS: Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head.

TOR: I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.
TOR: Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.
TOR: No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.

TOR: You're eating too much dairy. May I?

TV: . . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead.
TV: . . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.
TV: . . . third being waived in.

TV: Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill.
TV: Here's a new twist on car pooling: Early this morning, a lost Manhattanite drove through a residential backyard and wound up in a swimming pool near Ithaca, New York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a passenger, seemed a little freaked out.
TV: Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . .
TV: That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez. BOBBY: Hey,
TV: the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical.
TV: The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.
TVVOICE:Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.

UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
UNCLE LEO: What are you writing ? George at photo store
UNCLE LEO: What should I do with it ?
UNCLE LEO: What?
UNCLE LEO: Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
UNCLE LEO: You're not my nurse .
UNCLE LEO: Your wife?
UNSEEN: What do you say Cosmo?
USHA: Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place.
USHA: Here's the registry. Send her a gift, and be glad you did not have to go.
USHA: You're not going to the wedding, are you?
USHER:
USHER: All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out.
USHER: Do you have your stub?
USHER: Go ahead.
USHER: Haven't seen him.
USHER: Here you go.
USHER: Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?
USHER: I could let you see ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
USHER: I need to see your stub.
USHER: It's a big city, sir.
USHER: Mm hm.
USHER: No, no, these are your seats.
USHER: There's a seat in the front row.
USHER: Ticket, sir?
USHER: Well, you're going to have to wait, then.
USHER: Whatya got? One of those Caf Latte's in your shirt?
VACUUM: Y'know I think Joe might be >vroomvrooom<...
VANDELAY: How did you get in here?
VANDELAY: Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?
VANDELAY: Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?
VANDELAY: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
VANDELAY: Mr. Chiles.
VANDELAY: Mr. Hoyt.
VANDELAY: Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.
VANDELAY: Order in this court!
VANDELAY: Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned.
VANDELAY: Proceed.
VANDELAY: Sit down, Mr. Chiles.
VANDELAY: This is highly irregular.
VANDELAY: What do you mean?
VANDELAY: Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference?
VANDELEY: Order!
VANESSA: Almost exclusively...
VANESSA: Forget it.
VANESSA: How big a tip do you think it'd take to get him to stop?
VANESSA: How do you know Pamela?
VANESSA: How masculine...
VANESSA: I can't tell you.
VANESSA: I don't know. I just worry about trips like this.. It's a lot of pressure.
VANESSA: I know. You mentioned it.
VANESSA: I said, the market fluctuates. Remember?
VANESSA: I thought engineers do that.
VANESSA: I told you not to sell.
VANESSA: I'll supply the hat.
VANESSA: Importer?
VANESSA: Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.
VANESSA: No, it's got a little battery.
VANESSA: No, it's okay.
VANESSA: Not especially.
VANESSA: Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.
VANESSA: Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?
VANESSA: Oh, that was you!
VANESSA: Oh, you know Bricker! From where?
VANESSA: Oh, you've never heard of it.
VANESSA: Really. What do you design?
VANESSA: Really... That explains it...
VANESSA: Really? Could we go fishing up there?
VANESSA: Really? Which company?
VANESSA: Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
VANESSA: Sure! Hi!
VANESSA: That stock? I thought you got out of that?
VANESSA: That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost money on the stock.
VANESSA: That's probably why..
VANESSA: That's right! What're you doing here?
VANESSA: They have marlin in Vermont?
VANESSA: Vanessa.
VANESSA: Very funny! What do you do?
VANESSA: We gotta run. Happy birthday!
VANESSA: We went to law school together.
VANESSA: What can we do? It's raining.
VANESSA: Why didn't you do something?
VANESSA: Why don't you relax and take your jacket off?
VANESSA: Yeah, and that woman was your--
VANESSA: Yeah, I've been thinking about it.
VEGETABLE LASAGNA: Hello! Oh no. I'm sorry.
VEGETABLE LASAGNA: My name is Magnus.
VEGETABLE LASAGNA: Oh god. Elaine then slams her seat back several times into the legs of the passenger
VEGETABLE LASAGNA: Please don't shout. I can't take it.
VET: What are the symptoms?
VET: Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet?
VIC: Hey, you see that sign right there?
VIC: I never saw it.
VIC: I'll have to charge you for another machine.
VIC: I'm not responsible.
VIC: You can have this on Monday.
VIC: You ever hear of a bank?
VICTIM: Don't shoot.
VICTIM: Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!
VICTIM: Yeah, nothing. Nothing!
VICTORIA: Are you growing a beard?
VICTORIA: Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.
VICTORIA: Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!
VICTORIA: I guess ...
VICTORIA: I'm Victoria. Hi. Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone.
VICTORIA: Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.
VICTORIA: What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?
VICTORIA: Who are you, George Costanza?
VIOLIN PLAYER: Thank you.
VISITING TODAY WAS THROWING AWAY: Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
VIVIAN: Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening.
VIVIAN: Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow?
VIVIAN: Do you know anyone responsible?
VIVIAN: Elaine!
VIVIAN: Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.
VIVIAN: Elaine? Elaine?
VIVIAN: Elaine? What are you doing here?
VIVIAN: Her grandparent passed away five years ago.
VIVIAN: Hey, Elaine! How did it go?
VIVIAN: Hi...
VIVIAN: I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere.
VIVIAN: Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health problems lately.
VIVIAN: Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic?
VIVIAN: Oh, wait... Oohh...
VIVIAN: Ok.
VIVIAN: Really, why?
VIVIAN: Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful.
VIVIAN: She's American citizen, I have seen her passport.
VIVIAN: Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best.
VIVIAN: This is insane.
VIVIAN: Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight.
VIVIAN: Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call.
VIVIAN: Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around.
VIVIAN: Where's Jimmy?
VIVIAN: Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry?
VIVIAN: Yes it it.
VIVIAN: You haven't seen Jimmy for years.
VIVIAN: You...very knowledgeable.
VOGEL: Yes.

VOICE ON THE PHONE: Prophet and Goldstein.
VOICE: Federal Express.

VOICE: Yes, he went to South America.
VOLEG: Yes.
W: He canÂ’t hear you, you idiot. Why donÂ’t you just buy another one.
W: I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
W: It gets my rug clean.
W: Morning George.
W: Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
WAITER: . . . Thank you.
WAITER: An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. He's been stabbed.
WAITER: Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps.
WAITER: Are you ready to order?
WAITER: Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house.
WAITER: Excuse me, Elaine Benes?
WAITER: Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house.
WAITER: If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year.
WAITER: It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola.
WAITER: More bread?
WAITER: Ready?
WAITER: The chef said that he made it special for you.
WAITER: The lamb chops are good.
WAITER: Uh, have you decided yet? GeorgeÂ’s girlfriend: Yes. IÂ’ll have the lobster.
WAITER: We're out of Merlot.
WAITRESS: Ah, the bushmen?
WAITRESS: And for you?
WAITRESS: Are you going to pay for that?
WAITRESS: Are you ready?
WAITRESS: Can I get you anything else?
WAITRESS: Care to see our dessert menu?
WAITRESS: Careful, this plate is extremely hot. Elaine touching the plate.
WAITRESS: Garry Seinfield! I saw him on the Tonight Show.
WAITRESS: He does. In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone.
WAITRESS: Hi, are you ready to order? KRAMER: Do you ever yearn?
WAITRESS: Hold it a second. Don't you play on TV?
WAITRESS: How about you?
WAITRESS: I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?
WAITRESS: I think it's real turkey.
WAITRESS: Is everything alright?
WAITRESS: It's good. I like it.
WAITRESS: It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work.
WAITRESS: Mais Cafe?
WAITRESS: Menus?
WAITRESS: Mister Seinfeld. Mister Costanza.
WAITRESS: More coffee?
WAITRESS: Mute pragalas senor

WAITRESS: Oh, yeah I was sorry to hear she left.
WAITRESS: Ok Two bowls of Cheerios.
WAITRESS: Okay.
WAITRESS: Okay. What about you?
WAITRESS: RIGHT!
WAITRESS: She quit today. George runs to bathroom and hears retching sounds.
WAITRESS: Si
WAITRESS: So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.
WAITRESS: Thanks.
WAITRESS: The usual?
WAITRESS: There is nothing's finer than being in your diner. E, hu hu hu hu hu There is nothing's finer than being in your diner.?
WAITRESS: Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.
WAITRESS: Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one.
WAITRESS: Well, you ain't getting' it back.
WAITRESS: Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out.
WAITRESS: What apartment?
WAITRESS: What's the rent?
WAITRESS: What's your name?
WAITRESS: What?
WAITRESS: Yeah, can I take your order?
WAITRESS: Yeah, it's hard to figure.
WAITRESS: Yeah, me too.
WAITRESS: You are really startin' to get under my skin.
WALTER: Aren't you upset?
WALTER: Isn't that Zach?
WALTER: Oh he's Lou Filerman. He's new here. Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro.
WALTER: So, Elaine.. are you going to dance this year?
WALTER: Thanks. Everyone claps.
WALTER: Well..
WATKINS: All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying. GEORGE: I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
WATKINS: Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.
WATKINS: I love 'em.
WATKINS: It's T-bone.
WATKINS: That sounds good. I'll have one, too.
WELLS: Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.
WELLS: That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night.
WELLS: There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly.
WELLS: Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote There's no love lost with that group.
WELLS: Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.
WELLS: Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.
WELLS: Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.
WENDY: A delicate genius? George spots Elaine.
WENDY: Ah. Jerry starts to withdraw his head from the fridge, and Wendy is poised
WENDY: Bye Jerry. Wendy walks away down the street.
WENDY: Elaine?
WENDY: Have you tried heat and ice on it?
WENDY: Hi.
WENDY: How did you hear that?
WENDY: I am really glad I took the day off.
WENDY: I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?
WENDY: I'm dropping you off.
WENDY: I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal
WENDY: Let me give you my card. Wendy fishes in her bag and hands a card to George.
WENDY: Oh sure. You have insurance, right?
WENDY: Oh, hi Jerry. Wendy wanders over to the fridge.
WENDY: Oh, ho. Kramer presses the button and nothing happens. He turns the camera up,
WENDY: Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.
WENDY: Oh, well. Kramer raises his camera to take a picture of Wendy and her hair.
WENDY: Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
WENDY: Right. It's only three blocks.
WENDY: So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
WENDY: Sure. Jerry holds out his arm, with a bottle in his hand.
WENDY: Well, I'll see you guys later. Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
WENDY: Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy. Wendy walks out, into another room.
WENDY: Well, I...
WENDY: Well, why not?
WENDY: Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.
WENDY: What's going on?
WENDY: What's the problem?
WENDY: What, is there anything wrong with him? Elaine stares off for several seconds, with a faraway look in her eyes.
WENDY: Why, what's wrong with my hair?
WENDY: Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the Way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one
WENDY: Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
WENDY: Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
WENDY: Yes.
WEST: George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.
WEST: I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?
WEST: Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.
WEST: No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.
WEST: No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea.
WEST: So how are the seats?
WEST: Well, enjoy the game. I think you better take off that Orioles cap.
WEST: Well, if you have a lot of money.
WEST: Yes, yes, yes, I am!
WHATLEY: Hey! Kramer
WHATLEY: OH!! She's over at Dr.Cessman's office. We find it fun to swap now and then.
WHATLEY: Sheryl, would you ready the Nitro please? Whatley inhales the gas mask before handing it over to Jerry.
WHATLEY: So what'ill it be? Novocaine?
WHATLEY: Why don't we just clear a path first.
WHATLEY: Yeah Well....I do what I can. How've you been.
WHATLEY: You remember Mr. Thirsty.
WIFE: Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?
WILCOX: I would describe it as restrained jubilation. Mr. Ross: Murderer!
WILCOX: Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it.
WILHELM: ...did you go down to payroll?
WILHELM: ...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
WILHELM: And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for The cigarettes and the dive checks.
WILHELM: Are you feeling all right George?
WILHELM: George! George, get a hold of yourself!
WILHELM: George, have you seen Morgan?
WILHELM: George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
WILHELM: George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar.
WILHELM: George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?
WILHELM: George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very
WILHELM: George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
WILHELM: Get started? I don't understand, George.
WILHELM: Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.
WILHELM: Have you seen Morgan?
WILHELM: He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
WILHELM: I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a
WILHELM: I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
WILHELM: I understand.
WILHELM: Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh. Wilhelm wanders across the corridor, thinking to himself, he opens the
WILHELM: Lemme think here. George starts to follow Wilhelm into the men's room, but thinks better
WILHELM: Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
WILHELM: No, He's late.
WILHELM: Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.
WILHELM: Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
WILHELM: Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
WILHELM: Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
WILHELM: So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?
WILHELM: So... George snaps awake.
WILHELM: The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat
WILHELM: There's your answer. Downtown. Wilhelm leaves.
WILHELM: Top priority.
WILHELM: Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
WILHELM: Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
WILHELM: Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
WILHELM: What's the matter with you?!
WILHELM: What's this? KRAMER: Oh, it's a birthday card.
WILHELM: Yes George.
WILHELM: Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
WILHELM: Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
WILHELM: You look a little warm.
WILHELM: You mean you haven't been to payroll?
WILHELM: You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets.
WILHEM: I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the
WILHEM: If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward.
WILHEM: They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to
WILKIE: All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen.
WILKIE: I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.
WILLIAMS: Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?
WILLIE SR: ..A nickel!
WILLIE SR: I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel.
WILLIE SR: Not Skittles.
WILLIE: Are you saying he grabbed the candy bar away from you?
WILLIE: Candy line-up?
WILLIE: Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you donÂ’t talk.
WILLIE: He likes it!
WILLIE: I thought you said it was a Twix.
WILLIE: It took you an hour?
WILLIE: IÂ’m not.
WILLIE: Maybe it was.
WILLIE: Mr. Costanza, I really donÂ’t have time for this.
WILLIE: Nougat?
WILLIE: Positive?
WILLIE: Sir, what, exactly, is the problem?
WILLIE: What about the $100,000 bar?
WILLIE: When did you bring the car in?
WITNESS: Cock fighting.
WOMAN AT BEACH: There is a beached whale, she's dying.
WOMAN AT PHONE: Where? I didn't see you.
WOMAN BEHIND ELAINE: It's all yours.
WOMAN IN THE CROWD: Not my Harry. He flies first class.
WOMAN:
WOMAN: A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me! End.
WOMAN: A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
WOMAN: A thousand.
WOMAN: About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
WOMAN: All right, we're done. You can have it now.
WOMAN: And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
WOMAN: And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus
WOMAN: Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy? Of course, not
WOMAN: But I didn't do anything.
WOMAN: Bye George.
WOMAN: Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
WOMAN: David, you are so funny.
WOMAN: Do you know how to double-clutch?
WOMAN: Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
WOMAN: Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
WOMAN: Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
WOMAN: George Costanza? EstelleÂ’s son? At GeorgeÂ’s parentÂ’s house.
WOMAN: George, bye!
WOMAN: Get away from me you creep.
WOMAN: Get the bikes.
WOMAN: Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny! Newman rushes away dropping the letter on the ground.
WOMAN: Goin' on four years.
WOMAN: Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
WOMAN: Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
WOMAN: Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call?
WOMAN: Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
WOMAN: Hey, you forgot your keys.
WOMAN: Hi.
WOMAN: Hmm..
WOMAN: Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
WOMAN: How did this start?
WOMAN: How well do you know her?
WOMAN: I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
WOMAN: I had it autographed for my uncle.
WOMAN: I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
WOMAN: I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
WOMAN: I'm going to the bathroom. Be right back.
WOMAN: I'm gonna be busy for a while.
WOMAN: I'm taking your clothes.
WOMAN: It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
WOMAN: It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
WOMAN: IÂ’m allergic to coconut.
WOMAN: Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier for Elaine.
WOMAN: Like what?
WOMAN: Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
WOMAN: Make your-self comfortable. She steps in to bathroom.
WOMAN: Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you.
WOMAN: Mulva?
WOMAN: Newman, I'm bored.
WOMAN: Nice to meet you, George.
WOMAN: Nice to meet you.
WOMAN: Nice.
WOMAN: No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
WOMAN: No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.
WOMAN: No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately. (Kramer casually puts his hand on the wall, attempting to lean on it, but the corner is rounded, and he slides along it, eventually falling down. Fortunately, the other
WOMAN: No, no ,no. It's all right.
WOMAN: Nothin'? Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
WOMAN: Oh, don't worry. I do. She steps in to the bathroom
WOMAN: Oh, hello.
WOMAN: Oh, here. This is why.
WOMAN: Oh, hi.
WOMAN: Oh, I have Junior Mints.
WOMAN: Oh, Jerry...
WOMAN: Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... ...Joseph Puglia...
WOMAN: Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police The Old Mill Restaurant. Hurry! (Kramer takes off running down the street, looking for a cop. He meets up with two officers exiting an ice cream shop. Before he can tell them the urgent message,
WOMAN: Really?
WOMAN: See this red dot?
WOMAN: Seinsmelled?
WOMAN: So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
WOMAN: So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
WOMAN: So, are they a nice couple?
WOMAN: So, when's your due date?
WOMAN: Thank you. Newman feels the woman's coat material.
WOMAN: Thanks George, but I got it from here.
WOMAN: That man should really be in a sanitarium.
WOMAN: There's no exchanges on this.
WOMAN: They're quite exquisite!
WOMAN: They're so soft and milky white.
WOMAN: Waaaaaaaaa!
WOMAN: Well I won't be long.
WOMAN: Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone. George: You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed
WOMAN: Well they're not mine.
WOMAN: Well, come on!
WOMAN: Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage
WOMAN: Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
WOMAN: Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
WOMAN: Well, this is where I get off.
WOMAN: Well, you're reading the classifieds.
WOMAN: What about a shooting star?
WOMAN: What are you doing?
WOMAN: What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
WOMAN: What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
WOMAN: What is it?
WOMAN: What're you so tense about?
WOMAN: What's the problem?
WOMAN: What?
WOMAN: When you're dead, you're dead. That's it. You're not goin' anywhere...
WOMAN: Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
WOMAN: Which one?
WOMAN: Who are you?
WOMAN: Why don't you just make another wish?
WOMAN: Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.
WOMAN: Yeah I knew it was a bad idea. George is in agony thinking if he should go or stay. Then runs after her
WOMAN: Yeah, it's in my purse.
WOMAN: Yeah, what is it?
WOMAN: Yeah.
WOMAN: Yeah. I really have to be going.
WOMAN: Yes.
WOMAN: Yes?
WOMAN: You don't know my name, do you?
WOMAN: You know the time!
WOMAN: You know they changed the name from $100,000 bar to 100 Grand?
WOMAN: You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
WOMAN: You looking for a job?
