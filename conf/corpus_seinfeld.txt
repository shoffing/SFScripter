AARON: Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?
AARON: Bye
AARON: Easily
AARON: Elaine what do you say?

AARON: I could've done more. I could've done so much more.
AARON: I love France, I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give 'em to ya.
AARON: I was able to finagle two more tickets to My Fair Lady and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen.

AARON: This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. Water, they need some water
AARON: We can make a whole day of it.
AARON: Well I should be going.
AARON: Well see you later.

AARON: Yes.
AARON: Yes?
AARON: You know I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour?

ABBY: Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.
ABBY: Alright.
ABBY: And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a protégé?
ABBY: Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over.
ABBY: Bania?
ABBY: Cynthia would not date a hack.
ABBY: He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.
ABBY: Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor.
ABBY: Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protégé is a hack.
ABBY: I gotta run anyway.
ABBY: I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.
ABBY: I need someone I can trust.
ABBY: I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.
ABBY: I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act.
ABBY: I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.
ABBY: Looks that way.
ABBY: My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.
ABBY: No, it's more than that.
ABBY: Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia!
ABBY: So, great dinner last night.
ABBY: Well come join us, we could pull up a chair.
ABBY: Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor.
ABBY: What?
ABBY: Who?
ABBY: Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?
ABBY: Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.
ABBY: You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.
ADA: From the Daily Worker.
ADA: Natalie on line 2.
ADAM: Are you free Friday night?
ADAM: As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!
ADAM: But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.
ADAM: I'm a man!
ADAM: I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone.
ADAM: Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First, they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion!
ADAM: Well, that does me a lot of good. 'Early 20s'!
ADE: Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt.
ADE: Anaheim Hotel. You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods.
ADE: As you can see my references are impeccable. I think Id be a real asset here. My only concern is, I do take care of my mother. So will there be any late nights?
ADE: I am?
ADE: I cant thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. Im so grateful
ADE: It was just so generous.
ADE: It's definitely doable.
ADE: Mr. CO STAN ZA!
ADE: Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me that pillow.
ADE: Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand.
ADE: OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable.
ADE: Well apparently they can.
ADE: Well Im just, hm, doing my job.
ADE: Well thank you, Im flattered.
ADE: What can I say? Im ... Im good at what I do.
ADE: Yes, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner...
ADE: Yes, I think I do.
AENT: Miss Benes...

ALEC: Where will you stay?
ALEC: Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go See ya.
ALEC: Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. So it's a perfect solution.
ALEC: Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours.
ALEC: You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?

BEGINNINGS: In the 1600s most of central Queens from Jamaica Township to Long Island City was the Town of Newtown, a forest-and-farm area that during the American Revolution had a sparse, widely scattered population. However, development came rapidly in the 19th Century. In 1869, developers Alban P. Man and Edward Richmond carved out a section south of what is now Flushing Meadow-Corona Park and called it Richmond Hill. In the early 1900s, Man's sons, Arthur and Alrick, developed a community of their own at the site of the Richmond Hill Golf Club, which closed in 1909. They called it Kew after the London botanical gardens at Kew.
BEN: A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite breathtaking.
BEN: Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
BEN: Elaine, you have children?
BEN: Get out of my way...
BEN: He is something.
BEN: I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor.
BEN: I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out.
BEN: I guess I just don't care.
BEN: I'm grateful for every moment I have.
BEN: I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.
BEN: I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.
BEN: I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.
BEN: It was built by Mark Fargman. He build a lot of these homes here.
BEN: Life's too short to waste on you.
BEN: Like what?

BEN: What did you say?
BEN: What's wrong?
BEN: Yeah, he really is breathtaking.

BETH: David
BETH: George?!
BETH: He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?
BETH: Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?
BETH: Hi Jerry it's Beth.

BETH: I'm feeling really confused.
BETH: I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.
BETH: It was nice to get your call.
BETH: Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me.
BETH: Jerry? Elaine, Hi!
BETH: Like in the middle of our fight last night he did this thing that he always does where he asks questions to himself, aloud. And then answers them.
BETH: Mm-hm.
BETH: Oh really?
BETH: Oh, uh, George, this is my husband, David.
BETH: Oh, well you know it's funny George. Sometimes you don't know how you're really feeling about something until a person like you comes along and articulates it so perfectly.
BETH: ok
BETH: So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent.
BETH: Sure. George it's Jerry.
BETH: The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper.
BETH: Two.
BETH: Well actually, it had a lot to do with George's comment.
BETH: Well it wasn't just that, i realized after 3 years of marriage that David's little quirks were getting on my nerves a little.
BETH: Well where ever you are i appreciate it.
BETH: What was that all about?
BETH: Why would Elaine do that to me?
BETH: Ya he says he wants to say hello.
BETH: Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews.
BETSY: And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.
BETSY: But George, what if it's an emergency?
BETSY: Does she have any plans after she's released?
BETSY: George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in, her getting paroled.
BETSY: George, please. Hello? What? Oh my god!
BETSY: George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. This is my boyfriend, George.
BETSY: I'll be in my office if you need me.
BETSY: I'm not very hungry.
BETSY: No, no, it's not on...
BETSY: No.
BETSY: Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear so, I always try to sit to the right of people.
BETSY: So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. O.k. You, too. Get some sleep.
BETSY: Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!
BETSY: There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility.
BETSY: Those are our tennis courts.
BETSY: Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.
BETSY: What?
BETTE: Get me one of those Black and White cookies.

BETTE: What? Are you blind?
BETTE: White meat.
BIKER: About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! Lean!
BILL: My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.

BILLY: Everything, yeah. It's spotless.
BILLY: Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?
BILLY: How'd you sleep?
BILLY: No regrets?
BILLY: Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it.
BILLY: What do you mean?
BILLY: Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
BILLY: Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns.
BILLY: Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy.
BILLY: You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?
BLAINE: Elaine.
BLAINE: Enjoy Sack Lunch!

BLAINE: No.
BLAINE: Oh, two for The English Patient.
BLAINE: So, what d'you wanna see?
BLAINE: That's what I'm talking about.
BLAINE: Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient.
BLIND MAN: Excuse me, uh I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker?
BLIND MAN: I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose.
BLIND MAN: Tough luck! A deal's a deal.
BLIND MAN: What guy?
BLIND MAN: What's that about ladies' frames?
BLIND MAN: Where the hell are we going?
BLIND VIOLIN PLAYER: Freeze, Police!
BOB: Ah, could you repeat that?
BOB: But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?

BOMB COP: Looks like there's more compartments underneath.
BONNIE: Are you a velvet fan?
BONNIE: Aren't they great? Oh, Scott, hi. This is George. George, this is Scott, my roommate.
BONNIE: Do you like it?
BONNIE: George, Scott's gonna drop by. He said he never got his boxes. I'll get the towels.
BONNIE: George, what is wrong with you?
BONNIE: George, would you just stop?
BONNIE: George, you're being ridiculous.
BONNIE: George?
BONNIE: He's a great guy, you'll really like him.
BONNIE: Here we are.
BONNIE: Here, check out this view. If you lean out this window, you can see the river.
BONNIE: Hi, George.
BONNIE: Hi.
BONNIE: I asked Scott to move out.
BONNIE: It's gone. It was all his. Is this a label maker?
BONNIE: No, just throw my bras out of the way.
BONNIE: Oh, a cactus.
BONNIE: Scott! Remember what we talked about the other day? George is into it.
BONNIE: Thank Scott. He recommended it.
BONNIE: They were his. Besides, we don't need any of those things. We have each other.
BONNIE: Well, here we are. This is the place.
BONNIE: What do you mean?
BONNIE: What is it?
BONNIE: What?
BONNIE: Yes he is.
BONNIE: Yes. Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him.
BOOKIE: Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place..
BOOKIE: He had to be shot.
BOOKIE: Hello again, Miss Benes.
BOOKIE: Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.
BOOKIE: I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it.
BOOKIE: So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years.
BOOKIE: You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.
BOOKMAN: 25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long.
BOOKMAN: Bookman, Joe Bookman.
BOOKMAN: Criminals.
BOOKMAN: Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?
BOOKMAN: I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly, discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life. We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have a private life. While you're thinking about that, think about this: The library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final warning. Got that, kewpie-doll?
BOOKMAN: I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?
BOOKMAN: I'm a library cop.
BOOKMAN: We chase down library delinquents.
BOOKMAN: Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says New York Public Library? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy: Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!
BOOKMAN: What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle.
BOOKMAN: Who doesn't have instant coffee?
BOOKMAN: Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.
BOOKMAN: Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld.
BOOKMAN: Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?
BOOKMAN: Yeah. Coffee.
BOOKMAN: You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.
BOOKMAN: You don't have any instant coffee?
BOOKMAN: You got any coffee?
BOOKMAN: You think this is all a big joke, don't you?
BOOKMAN: You took this book out in 1971.
BOOKMAN: You're a comedian, you make people laugh.
BOSS: I'm surprised.
BOSS: No reason.
BOTH: Hello...
BOTH: Kramer, Kramer, get in here.
BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!
BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!
BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!
BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!
BOTH: Seems a little short, yeah..
BOUNCER: Let's go. Private party.
BOY: Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?
BOY: Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?
BOY: Gammy!
BOY: Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?
BOY: Thanks a lot.
BOY: The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it?
BOYFRIEND: I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication.
BOYFRIEND: Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous.
BOYFRIEND: Oh, it's this patient.
BOYSENBERRY: The edible fruit obtained by crossing the blackberry, raspberry, and loganberry.
BRADY: Hi,
BRADY: Hi, I'm Brady.
BRETT: After the song, babe.
BRETT: Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the twelve cents?
BRETT: Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.
BRETT: Don't worry. It's no charge to you.
BRETT: Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?
BRETT: Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start.
BRETT: Elaine, I...
BRETT: Elaine, the song.
BRETT: Farbman.
BRETT: Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?
BRETT: Hey Jerry!
BRETT: How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.
BRETT: I can't remember his name!
BRETT: I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?
BRETT: I hope not.
BRETT: I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.
BRETT: I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.
BRETT: I'm sure things'll pick up for you.
BRETT: It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...
BRETT: Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.
BRETT: Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.
BRETT: No. It's mine.
BRETT: Not the Farbman!!
BRETT: Nothing's working for you, is is?
BRETT: Oops.
BRETT: That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.
BRETT: The song.
BRETT: There's no sign of Kramer.
BRETT: We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
BRETT: Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.
BRETT: Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue.
BRETT: Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.
BRETT: You know Farbman?
BRIDGET: Jerry, what happened?
BRIDGET: Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour.
BROADCAST DATE: May 14, 1998
BRODY: Are you out of your mind?
BRODY: Brody, I'm comin' up.
BRODY: Brody.
BRODY: Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.
BRODY: How'd it turn out?
BRODY: I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.
BRODY: I need the tape.
BRODY: I want the tape.
BRODY: I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. May I borrow this?
BRODY: I've never seen such beautiful work.
BRODY: Is that it?
BRODY: It's for all of us. Is there a problem?
BRODY: Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.
BRODY: Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.
BRODY: Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!
BRODY: May I use your phone?
BRODY: Nah.
BRODY: So where's the tape?
BRODY: Uh, I got a cramp.
BRODY: Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.
BRODY: What are you some kind of tough guy?
BRODY: Where's the tape?
BRODY: You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted.

BRYANT: And speaking of clothing, that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.
BRYANT: Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert?
BRYANT: Back now, 7:46. On Tuesday the 19th here in New York there will be a benefit for the Goodwill Industries - a used clothing organization that provides services to the needy. One of the performers will be comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, good morning.
BRYANT: Did you hear that?
BRYANT: Whose shirt is it?
BRYANT: You look kinda like a pirate.
BRYANT: You're all kinda, kinda puffed up.
BRYANT: You.. ah, look, I'm sorry, it is just a VERY unusual shirt. It could be kind of a whole new look for you.. you know, you could put a patch over an eye, you could be kind of like the pirate-comedian.
BUBBLE BOY: It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops.
BUBBLE BOY: Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint.
BUBBLE BOY: Moors!
BUBBLE BOY: Moors.
BUBBLE BOY: That's a joke - the Moors.
BUBBLE BOY: There's no Moops, you idiot.
BUBBLE BOY: Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit.
BUBBLE BOY: What the hell are all you looking at?
BUCKLES: A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
BUCKLES: But Jerry, quit riffing!
BUCKLES: Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?
BUCKLES: Come on, we can still catch most of ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
BUCKLES: Do you think I need to lose some weight?
BUCKLES: Hey, do you think this is funny? ``Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!''
BUCKLES: Hey, Jer!
BUCKLES: I had a point?
BUCKLES: Jerry!
BUCKLES: Jerry! Call me when you get home so I know you're okay!
BUCKLES: Jerry! Don't start up with me!
BUCKLES: Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, *please*, let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?
BUCKLES: Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!
BUCKLES: Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.
BUCKLES: Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.
BUCKLES: Jerry, take the coat. Please. One month.
BUCKLES: No no no, take 55th.
BUCKLES: Really? Do you really mean that?
BUCKLES: That athlete's foot bit killed!
BUCKLES: We should see ``Rochelle Rochelle''. I hear it's really hot.
BUCKLES: You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?
BUCKLES: You're leaving?
BUDDY: And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a hundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took!
BUDDY: Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too.
BUDDY: Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used to steal my soda bottles. and cash 'em in for the deposits, uh?

CAPTAIN: Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this equipment!
CAPTAIN: Kramer?! What the hell are you doing back there?
CAPTAIN: Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, will be approximately 22 hours.
CAPTAIN: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...
CAPTAIN: Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.
CAPTAIN: Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are.
CAPTAIN: Stay out of this, Kramer.
CAPTAIN: Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems.

CAR THIEF: Hello, Kramer.

CAR WASHER: We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.

CASTRO: And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one.
CASTRO: Ordinarily I would not grant such a request but I've heard you are, uh, how you say, Communista simpatico, eh?
CASTRO: Si, si. Come here. I understand you are very interested in one of our players, eh?
CASTRO: They will play for your Yankees.

CELIA: If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!
CELIA: Jerry, what are you doing?
CELIA: Nice to meet you.
CELIA: No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.
CELIA: No, it's standard issue.
CELIA: No. Thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?
CELIA: Oh yeah the toys.
CELIA: Ohhh Jerry. They're priceless. They've never been played with.
CELIA: So, are you the head of the foundation?
CELIA: This was fun.
CELIA: Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out.
CELIA: What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?
CELIA: What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?
CELIA: What video did you get?
CELIA: Who's he?
CELIA: Yeah. Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here for you.

CHELSEA: Big deal.
CHELSEA: So, can I keep this treatment?
CHELSEA: What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on...
CHELSEA: Why are you breathing so hard?
CHELSEA: Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.

CHERYL: Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
CHERYL: So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
CHERYL: Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.
CHERYL: Stop it, you're killing me!!
CHERYL: That's right!
CHERYL: That's so sad. What do you do?
CHERYL: Was he Chinese?
CHERYL: Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.
CHERYL: Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
CHERYL: Would you like to join us?
CHERYL: Yeah, I know!
CHERYL: You're a very serious person, aren't you?
CHILES: Bubble Boy?
CHILES: Do you think it's funny?
CHILES: Good morning.
CHILES: Hello? Damn. They're ready.
CHILES: Here.
CHILES: I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.
CHILES: Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?
CHILES: Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that.
CHILES: Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed.
CHILES: Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990.
CHILES: Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular.
CHILES: Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady.
CHILES: Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.
CHILES: That's right.
CHILES: Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let's move on.
CHILES: Vanda who?
CHILES: We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days.
CHILES: What's a Bubble Boy?
CHILES: Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?
CHILES: Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.
CHILES: You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase.
CHILES: You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts, right away.
CHILES: Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential.
CHIROPRACTOR: I'm a chiropractor.
CHIROPRACTOR: I'm afraid not.
CHIROPRACTOR: You could aggravate it. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.
CHOATE: Help - someone help.
CHOATE: I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no.
CHOATE: My marble rye.
CHOATE: Oh no.
CHOATE: Stop it.
CHOATE: That's right.
CHOATE: Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man.
CHRISTIE: Ahem! Are you looking for something?
CHRISTIE: Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go back to my apartment, so I can change?
CHRISTIE: Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.
CHRISTIE: Excuse me. Elaine?
CHRISTIE: Get out.
CHRISTIE: Here we are.
CHRISTIE: I know exactly what you mean.
CHRISTIE: I think your friend needs some help over there.
CHRISTIE: If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to bed.
CHRISTIE: Jerry. I don't think so.
CHRISTIE: No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.
CHRISTIE: Oh my god!
CHRISTIE: Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, right?
CHRISTIE: Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you.
CHRISTIE: Well, I guess I'll go change.
CHRISTIE: Yes, thank you.
CHRISTIE: Yes. How y'doing?
CINDY: All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?
CINDY: For my maid services. You booked me for today.
CINDY: Hi, Elaine.
CINDY: Hi, Kramer.
CINDY: I can't find my earring. Oh, here it is.
CINDY: I don't want any money from you.
CINDY: I made the bed.
CINDY: No. My money.
CINDY: No. That was the maid.
CINDY: So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?
CINDY: So?
CINDY: Thanks Jerry, gotta run.
CINDY: Thanks, Jerry. Bye.
CINDY: The girlfriend.
CINDY: What do you want?
CINDY: What was that?
CINDY: Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.
CINDY: Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.
CINDY: You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid.
CINDY: Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.
CLAIE: Uh huh.
CLAIMS TO FAME: Kew Gardens, home of both the Queens Borough Hall and the Queens criminal courts, was also the home of jurist Richard S.

CLAIRE: Are you ready?
CLAIRE: Dont worry, I gave him a little caffeine. Hell perk up.
CLAIRE: Its missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...its very challenging work.
CLAIRE: Id have to say, uuhh, no.
CLAIRE: Mr. Seinfeld. Mr. Costanza.
CLAIRE: To be polite.
CLAIRE: Trust me George. No one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine.
CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?
CLARE: Catch you later.
CLARE: Good-bye!
CLARE: He is fat!
CLARE: I dont believe this. I am not looking up if youre going to do that voice.
CLARE: Im leaving too.
CLARE: Never.
CLARE: No!
CLARE: No, Im fine. Just as long as you dont ever do that voice again.
CLARE: So is it fun humiliating me?
CLARE: So Ill call you tonight?
CLARE: So whats your decision?
CLARE: So you think Im fat?
CLARE: So, youre insane?
CLARE: Thats right.
CLARE: What are you laughing about? Tell me.
CLARE: Whats so funny?
CLARE: Whats wrong with the belt?
CLAYTON: ...'till this bastard over here says: let's call the sons o'bitches and go visit 'em on New York!
CLAYTON: Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!

CLAYTON: Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' to Houston!
CLAYTON: uh...is that you, George?
CLAYTON: Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? 30 000 feet above your head, you bastard!
CLAYTON: You a big drinker, George?
CLEANING WOMAN: A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
CLEANING WOMAN: Hello.
CLEANING WOMAN: Oh! Is that cashmere?
CLEANING WOMAN: Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.
CLEANING WOMAN: Okay, okay, can I open it now?
CLEANING WOMAN: What's this?
CLEANING WOMAN: When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, what do you call this most beautiful fabric?, and he said they call it cashmere. I repeated the words cashmere, cashmere. I asked if I could have it, and he said No. Get away from me. Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.
CLEANING WOMAN: Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.

COP 2: I don't know.
COP 2: No, I think he's trying to tell us something. What is it? Trouble?! Trouble? Where? Where's trouble? Trouble at the Old Mill?! Oh my god! Good boy, good boy! Lead the way! Come on.
COP 2: Shoot people...

COP: Hey! Hey, get back here!
COP: I don't think so.
COP: I got a little hungry.
COP: I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
COP: Lady, you sold me. Hey, you with the hose.
COP: Looks like a possible 5-19.
COP: Looks like it.
COP: Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!
COP: Mr. Costanza?
COP: Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.
COP: Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
COP: Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.
COP: Shut up.
COP: Thanks.
COP: That's smog strangler.
COP: This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.
COP: This your apartment?
COP: Well, well. The 'white whale'.
COP: Well, you're just gonna have to wait.
COP: What do got over there?
COP: What is your problem?
COP: What?
COP: What?
COP: Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
COP: Yeah! You got a problem with that?
COP: Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.
COP: Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.
COP: Yeah, go ahead.
COP: Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.
COP: Yeah.
COP: Yeah.
COP: Yeah? So why didn't you?
COP: You Cosmo Kramer?
COP: You mean a purse?
COP: You recognize this piece of fabric?
COP: You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
COP: You're under arrest.
COP: You're under arrest.
COP: Your what?
COPS: No...
CORBIN BERNSEN: How ya doing?
CORBIN BERNSEN: It never ends, does it?
CORBIN BERNSEN: Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.
CORBIN BERNSEN: Really.
CORBIN BERNSEN: Short little bald guy with glasses.
CORBIN BERNSEN: So you killed the cat.
CORBIN BERNSEN: Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?

CORINNE: I'm waitin for two people!
CORINNE: So I am walkin' along, minding my own business when all off the sudden this thing comes flying out of nowhere and clonks me right on the head.
CORINNE: Stop it! Stop it!
CORINNE: What!
CORINNE: Whatever you say, Cro..w-well!
CORINNE: Ya know it was somebody told me they thought they saw that thing come out of a limousine.
CORINNE: Yeah, I guess I'd better. I wouldn't want to take any attention away from the hookers!
CORINNE: Yeah.
CORINNE: Yeah.

CYNTHIA: Best seat in the house. right next to the kitchen.
CYNTHIA: Excuse me?
CYNTHIA: Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?
CYNTHIA: First of all, what does he do?
CYNTHIA: Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you
CYNTHIA: Has he been close?
CYNTHIA: Has he ever been married?
CYNTHIA: He didn't really try to poison his boss?
CYNTHIA: He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.
CYNTHIA: He's bald?
CYNTHIA: He's not working?! How come he's not working?
CYNTHIA: Hello, Abby.
CYNTHIA: Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.
CYNTHIA: Hi.
CYNTHIA: How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.
CYNTHIA: I am very worried, I am never late.
CYNTHIA: I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.
CYNTHIA: I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.
CYNTHIA: I missed my period.
CYNTHIA: I said to him, I really appreciate this, but I just got my period. And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--
CYNTHIA: Is he nuts?
CYNTHIA: Is Jerry one of the good ones?
CYNTHIA: Kenny Bania.
CYNTHIA: No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.
CYNTHIA: No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.
CYNTHIA: Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.
CYNTHIA: Russell, can we eat?
CYNTHIA: Russell, where's the TV Guide.
CYNTHIA: See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.
CYNTHIA: So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.
CYNTHIA: So he will be bald.
CYNTHIA: There's just no men out there, you know?
CYNTHIA: Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.
CYNTHIA: Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me? and eventually I just go, You're right.
CYNTHIA: What does he look like?
CYNTHIA: What does he look like?
CYNTHIA: What?
CYNTHIA: Who says I'm not bitter?
CYNTHIA: Why did he get fired?
CYNTHIA: Yeah. How'd you know?
DAN: Bill, how was your weekend?
DAN: Elaine?
DAN: Elaine?
DAN: Fine weekend.
DAN: Good.
DAN: I wouldn't say all the time.
DAN: Is Jerry in there?
DAN: No, I don't.
DAN: No, I'm not.
DAN: No, this is Dan!
DAN: Oh, Kramer?
DAN: Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.
DAN: Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.
DAN: The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.
DAN: Well this situation is driving me crazy. He's all I think about. I can't get him out of my mind.
DAN: Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. Lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor someday.
DAN: What?
DAN: Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.
DAN: You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
DANA: Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?
DANA: George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?
DANA: George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.
DANA: Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.
DANA: Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down.
DANA: I think you'd better go.
DANA: I think you'd better go.
DANA: I thought you didn't believe in God?
DANA: I would.
DANA: I'm trying to help you.
DANA: It doesn't matter, so ...
DANA: It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.
DANA: It wasn't funny.
DANA: It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?
DANA: It's like a discoloration. It's white.
DANA: No, I didn't find it funny.
DANA: No. Let me try...
DANA: Okay, we're getting somewhere.
DANA: So uh, she broke up with you? ...
DANA: That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.
DANA: Ugh, ..
DANA: Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it.
DANA: Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.
DANA: Well, no, I -
DANA: Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.
DANA: YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.
DANA: Yeah.
DANA: Yes, yes I did.
DANA: You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...
DANA: You'd better get that checked out.
DANIELLE: Come on, let's just eat our crepes.
DANIELLE: George, I can't move in with you.
DANIELLE: He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.
DANIELLE: Hi.
DANIELLE: I wanted to give it to you in person.
DANIELLE: I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.
DANIELLE: I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.
DANIELLE: It's Neil's.
DANIELLE: Neil!
DANIELLE: Neil.
DANIELLE: Neil.
DANIELLE: No, you're a little taller.
DANIELLE: Oh, I am sorry. I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend here. He looks just like you.
DANIELLE: Oh, no. He got held up at work.
DANIELLE: Sorry George.
DANIELLE: Uh-huh. Sorry.
DANIELLE: Well, goodnight.
DANIELLE: Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.
DANIELLE: What?
DANIELLE: Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.
DANIELLE: Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.
DANIELLE: Yeah.
DANIELLE: Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you.
DANIELLE: You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I know a great breakfast place, right around the corner.
DANIELLE: You know, Neil called me today.
DANIELLE: You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?
DANNY TARTABULL: I'm sure it's fine.
DANNY TARTABULL: This isn't gonna take long, is it?
DANNY TARTABULL: Want this last donut?
DANNY TARTABULL: What are you doing?
DANNY TARTABULL: You sure?
DAPHNE: Daphne.
DAPHNE: Eggs are eggs.
DAPHNE: George, first let me just say I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean it's so rare in men these days an, that's what makes this all the more difficult.
DAPHNE: George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...
DAPHNE: Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?
DAPHNE: He told me not to get involved with you.
DAPHNE: Heh, he was carrying these two pieces of pizza...
DAPHNE: I thought we were going to spend the day together.
DAPHNE: Is it true?
DAPHNE: Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.
DAPHNE: Maybe you don't want to move in.
DAPHNE: Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today.
DAPHNE: The other day after work some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George...
DAPHNE: Uh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid the worst of it is it's someone you know. Jerry Persheck.
DAPHNE: Why not?
DAPHNE: Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up hurting me.
DARREN: Hi, this is Darren from Kramers office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule a lunch with you at Monks coffee shop.
DARREN: I dont care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.
DARREN: I havent had time to leave.
DARREN: In 10 minutes. Do you need directions?
DARREN: Mr. Kramer says, hey buddy!
DARREN: Oh that sounds interesting sir.
DARREN: Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set something up now?
DARREN: Oh, hey, Im Darren. Im new here.
DARREN: Right!
DARREN: Sorry Mr. Seinfeld.
DARREN: Well, Ill call back in 5 minutes to confirm.
DARREN: Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didnt want to miss anything.
DARREN: What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills.
DARRYL: All right, I'm... Asian.
DARRYL: Aren't you?
DARRYL: Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand.
DARRYL: Does that matter?
DARRYL: Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!
DARRYL: God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple.
DARRYL: Hey.
DARRYL: Hi, Elaine.
DARRYL: I don't feel like eating.
DARRYL: I'm black. Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream. Did you hear that?
DARRYL: I'm black?
DARRYL: Isn't that optional?
DARRYL: Isn't that unbelievable!?
DARRYL: Just to mess with 'em.
DARRYL: My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is.
DARRYL: Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later.
DARRYL: Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it.
DARRYL: Oh.
DARRYL: So, we're just a couple of white people?
DARRYL: So, what are you?
DARRYL: Sure.
DARRYL: Sure.
DARRYL: They're... African.
DARRYL: We are. Because you're Hispanic.
DARRYL: Well, I don't do that stuff.
DARRYL: Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa.
DARRYL: What are you talking about?
DARRYL: Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?
DARRYL: Wow, it's got so many functions.
DARRYL: Yo, you! Turn it down!
DARRYL: Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants.
DAVID: All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.
DAVID: All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.
DAVID: Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely
DAVID: Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.
DAVID: Bad gasket?
DAVID: But Mr. Dalrimple--
DAVID: David Richardson.
DAVID: Elaine, here's to you being there.
DAVID: Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
DAVID: Excuse me. Beth
DAVID: George please, please I'm fine.
DAVID: Good!
DAVID: Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right?
DAVID: Hey it's George
DAVID: Hi George
DAVID: How do you feel?
DAVID: I can't do the move.
DAVID: I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
DAVID: I'll come up with some new stuff.
DAVID: Just had our third anniversary on April 8th
DAVID: No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.
DAVID: No, I'm sorry.
DAVID: No, let's go in.
DAVID: Oh fiance. Boy you coulda done a lot better than him. Come on Elaine lets go.
DAVID: Oh, he's ruined it for me.
DAVID: Oh, hi, Jerry.
DAVID: Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.
DAVID: right
DAVID: Something the matter?
DAVID: Sure.
DAVID: Then what is it?
DAVID: Uh-huh.
DAVID: Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.
DAVID: Well, that's easy for you to say.
DAVID: What is all this?
DAVID: What kind of car is it?
DAVID: What move?
DAVID: What?
DAVID: Whatever. I don't even do it.
DAVID: Wow that's so touching
DAVID: Yeah, that's right.
DAVID: Yeah.
DAVID: You know as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is George's fault
DAVID: You're Jerry right?
DAVID: You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.
DAVOLA: '...Travelling along...'
DAVOLA: 'Cos you really look familiar.
DAVOLA: Do I know you?
DAVOLA: No, I don't think so.
DAVOLA: Oh really.
DAVOLA: Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale.
DEAN JONES: As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.
DEAN JONES: Im sorry, but we cant allow Darren to continue working with you.
DEAN JONES: You fly is open.
DEBBY: Can you keep a secret?
DEBBY: Don't complain, at least you have your health.
DEBBY: George, look out for that man!
DEBBY: I didn't say hi.
DEBBY: I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, h... he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I... I fell in love with him.
DEBBY: N... no, not really. Why, is it... a date?
DEBBY: Nice car.
DEBBY: No. It's not a date.
DEBBY: Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the fact is... I shouldn't say anything.
DEBBY: So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?
DEBBY: Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi.
DEBBY: Yeah, regards.
DEDICATION: In memory of our friend, Lloyd Bridges.
DEENA: And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.
DEENA: Boy, those were some crazy times.
DEENA: George Costanza, is that you?
DEENA: George, I'm only trying to help...
DEENA: George, this is the best thing for you.
DEENA: George?
DEENA: I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.
DEENA: I see you're finally getting some help.
DEENA: I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.
DEENA: I'll be back same time next week, Pop.
DEENA: I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.
DEENA: I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?
DEENA: Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.
DEENA: Oh my God!
DEENA: Poor Lloyd.
DEENA: So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
DEENA: So, you want my father to pay for this?
DEENA: So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?
DEENA: Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop.
DEENA: That man was wearing glasses.
DEENA: That was your best friend?
DEENA: The man with the flowers?
DEENA: To park her horse?
DEENA: Uhn, it was too much for him.
DEENA: Well, I guess it's possible.
DEENA: What cashier?
DEENA: What?
DEENA: Who?
DEENA: Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
DEENA: You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
DEENSFREI: Good for you.....You are really independant.
DEENSFREI: he runs the AMCA
DEENSFREI: My name is Arnold
DEENSFREI: No. No I..I insist. I'll grab the next one.
DEENSFREI: Oh! Please, go ahead take it
DEENSFREI: Very nice to meet you Cosmo. Are you heading home?
DEENSFREI: What is your name?
DEENSFREI: Yes ! Splendid. That's a great idea.
DELIVERY BOY: Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment?
DELIVERY BOY: You really live here?
DELIVERY GUY: Delivery. Elaine Benes?
DELIVERY GUY: Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?
DELIVERY GUY: We're from the Lumbar Yard, we got your mattress.
DELIVERY GUY: You have to sign for it.
DELIVERY MAN: Delivery from Melody Stationaries.
DELIVERY MAN: Just sign there.
DELIVERY MAN: No. It's just a pen.
DELIVERY MAN: No. You have, like, a dot on your face. Whoever's doing that is very clever.
DELIVERY MAN: Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?
DENIM VEST: From Tim Whatley's party?
DENIM VEST: Hi!
DENIM VEST: Hmm?
DENIM VEST: Okay. Sure. Do you have the mumps?
DENIM VEST: They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time?
DENIM VEST: Typhoid?
DENIM VEST: Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something.
DENIM VEST: Yama - Hama!
DENIM VEST: You look.. different.
DENISE: George?
DENISE: Good, good.
DENISE: Likewise. Have you been waiting long?
DENISE: Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.
DENISE: Oh.. thank you.
DENNIS: I wonder, could you pick up my mail?
DENNIS: In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week?
DENNIS: It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. I'll split it with ya.
DENNIS: Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder...
DENTIST: Alright. Sit down.
DENTIST: Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.
DENTIST: It's possible.
DENTIST: Jon Voight bit you? The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks!
DENTIST: Somebody bit you?
DEPUTY: California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.
DEPUTY: Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85, 000 and as much as five years in prison.
DEPUTY: Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around.
DEPUTY: You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.
DETECTIVE: All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?
DETECTIVE: Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up well.
DETECTIVE: And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is all burnt out.
DETECTIVE: Get your coat, we gotta take you in.
DETECTIVE: How d'you do. Thanks for coming down.
DETECTIVE: I see.
DETECTIVE: I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make sure.
DETECTIVE: Look at the clutch.
DETECTIVE: Okay, go ahead.
DETECTIVE: One of our patrolmen stumbled over this.
DETECTIVE: The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap.
DETECTIVE: We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot.
DETECTIVE: Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.
DETECTIVE: What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?
DETECTIVE: Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took their time, they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of their way to gouge the sides of every piston, and the turbo was separated from the housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe.
DETECTIVE: Yes ma'am.
DETECTIVE: You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.
DETECTIVE: Your car's not a turbo?
DEVOLA: Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.
DEVOLA: Hello Jerry.
DEVOLA: I dreopped a script off.
DEVOLA: Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?
DEVOLA: Why shouldn't I look good?
DEVOLA: Why?
DEVOLA: You don't have to say anything.
DEVOLA: You want to hit me?
DEVOLA: You're under no obligation to shake my hand.
DIANE: George is a marine biologist?!
DIANE: He was always such a goof-off. I mean did he ever get anywhere?
DIANE: Hmhm.
DIANE: How are you?
DIANE: How long has it been?
DIANE: How, how could you guys have turned this place down, its such a great location and its...so close to the park.
DIANE: Huh. I've been seeing you on TV you're doin' great.
DIANE: Its Diane, Diane DeConn, from Queens college.
DIANE: Jerry?
DIANE: Save the whale George... for me.
DIANE: Uh-Really?
DIANE: Well, it was nice to meet you.
DIANE: What are those people doing over there?
DIANE: What's going on over here?
DIANE: Wow.
DIANE: Yeah? What field?
DIANE: You know I got the Alumni magazine. What ever happened to your friend George? I notice I never see his name in there.
DIANE: Your parents must be so proud of you, George.
DICK: Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?
DICK: I don't know.
DICK: I got the cranberry juice.
DICK: I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.
DICK: Is that cashmere?
DICK: It's off the wagon.
DICK: Merry Christmas.
DICK: So... you're Jerry.
DICK: The only stench is comming from you.
DICK: What the hell do you know about wagons?
DICK: What's this?
DICK: You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.
DICK: You mean on the wagon.
DIRECTOR: ...and there's your scene. Stand-ins
DIRECTOR: Ok everybody that's lunch... one hour.
DISPATCHER: Attention Company 390, structure fire at Leapin' Larry's Appliance Warehouse.
DJ ON RADIO: Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND.
DJ ON RADIO: Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker.
DJ ON RADIO: That was Artie Shaw, Honeysuckle Jump.
DOCTER: Not shot, dog bite.
DOCTER: Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang.
DOCTER: Okay.
DOCTER: Yes, very much.
DOCTOR: ..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
DOCTOR: A biopsy.
DOCTOR: A-hu.
DOCTOR: Ah--that's not necessarily true.
DOCTOR: Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
DOCTOR: All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
DOCTOR: All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
DOCTOR: All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
DOCTOR: And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
DOCTOR: And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
DOCTOR: Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.
DOCTOR: Are you asking because you saw 20/20 last night?
DOCTOR: Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor.
DOCTOR: Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
DOCTOR: Excuse me, Are you the husband?
DOCTOR: First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.
DOCTOR: From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
DOCTOR: Fungicide? Fungus?
DOCTOR: Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
DOCTOR: He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
DOCTOR: Hi Roy.
DOCTOR: Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
DOCTOR: Huh?
DOCTOR: I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
DOCTOR: I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
DOCTOR: I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
DOCTOR: I said, good-bye.
DOCTOR: I was going to kiss you good night.
DOCTOR: I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
DOCTOR: I'll need a urine sample.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that.
DOCTOR: I've examined you.
DOCTOR: I've looked at your X-rays.
DOCTOR: It happens.
DOCTOR: Its my favorite toe.
DOCTOR: Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
DOCTOR: May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
DOCTOR: Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.
DOCTOR: No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
DOCTOR: No youre not.
DOCTOR: No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: No, not really.
DOCTOR: No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
DOCTOR: Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms.
DOCTOR: Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
DOCTOR: Oh uh, wheres the bathroom?
DOCTOR: Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
DOCTOR: Oh, sorry.
DOCTOR: Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
DOCTOR: Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
DOCTOR: One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Saying what?
DOCTOR: She expired.
DOCTOR: She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
DOCTOR: Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
DOCTOR: That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
DOCTOR: That's probably what did it.
DOCTOR: The results of your sperm test are in.
DOCTOR: There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
DOCTOR: There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
DOCTOR: Think about it. Excuse me.
DOCTOR: Those can be very refreshing.
DOCTOR: Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
DOCTOR: Uh, hello. Uh, Mr. Costanza?
DOCTOR: Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
DOCTOR: We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
DOCTOR: We have to...
DOCTOR: We, could put him to sleep.
DOCTOR: Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
DOCTOR: Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
DOCTOR: Well I don't know what it is.
DOCTOR: Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
DOCTOR: Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
DOCTOR: Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
DOCTOR: Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't go that far.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm sorry.....She's gone.
DOCTOR: Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
DOCTOR: Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
DOCTOR: What?
DOCTOR: Which one is the son?
DOCTOR: Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yes
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
DOCTOR: You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
DOCTOR: You uh, You have 30 minutes.
DOG OWNER: Hey who are you calling stupid?
DOG OWNER: I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, the one that was messing with my dog.
DOG OWNER: It's okay with me.
DOG OWNER: Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would you?
DOG OWNER: Thanks a lot!
DOG OWNER: Well I would love to talk with her. She lives on 81st Street, right?
DOLL: Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!
DOLL: Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!
DOLL: You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!
DOLORES: Hi. I heard you got engaged.
DOLORES: Jerry, hi.
DOLORES: Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.
DOLORES: Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya.
DOLORES: So who broke it off?
DOLORES: You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here.
DONALD: COME ON.
DONALD: HEY MA WHAT THE HELL DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND HERE? I'M STARVIN'. AND IF IT'S PEANUT BUTTER, I'M GONNA SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE.

DONALD: This is a piece of crap!
DONALD: WELL I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.
DONALD: What a sellout! Give me that remote!
DONALD: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? NEVER SEEN A KID IN A BUBBLE BEFORE?
DONALD: WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
DONALD: WHO ARE YOU? Where's Seinfeld?
DONNA : Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.
DONNA: ...No.
DONNA: Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
DONNA: Anyway, I'm really sorry.
DONNA: Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!
DONNA: Are those Cotton Dockers?
DONNA: Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
DONNA: Did you think I was Chinese?...
DONNA: Dont bother, Im leaving.
DONNA: George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
DONNA: Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.
DONNA: He told you about that?
DONNA: Hi.
DONNA: Hi.
DONNA: Hi. Sorry I'm late.
DONNA: I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.
DONNA: I dont know. I like the, guys.
DONNA: I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.
DONNA: I dont wanna hear it.
DONNA: I mean: I'm Donna Chang.
DONNA: I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
DONNA: I'm Donna Chang!
DONNA: I'm Donna Chang...
DONNA: I'm from Long Island.
DONNA: I'm sorry...?
DONNA: Is there anything else about you I should know?
DONNA: It's Donna Chang.
DONNA: Id invite you up, but the place is being painted.
DONNA: Im Donna.
DONNA: Jerry.
DONNA: Let me see. Piece of cake. Bring it
DONNA: Never?
DONNA: No it's not.
DONNA: No one is telling you to like it.
DONNA: No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
DONNA: No, what are you talking about.
DONNA: Oh! Hi! I'm Donna Chang. I just spoke to your mother before.
DONNA: Really?
DONNA: Really? I like that commercial.
DONNA: Ridiculous.
DONNA: She said you should come too.
DONNA: She was trying to call you, but--
DONNA: So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.
DONNA: Thanks again for the movie.
DONNA: Thats amazing.
DONNA: Thats Irish.
DONNA: Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants.
DONNA: Thats the point.
DONNA: Thursdays great.
DONNA: Unless you want to go to your place.
DONNA: Used to be Changstein.
DONNA: Values are very important.
DONNA: Wait, wait. Hes in the bathroom.
DONNA: Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
DONNA: Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!
DONNA: Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.
DONNA: Yeah, its clever.
DONNA: Yeah, thats the one.
DONNA: Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.
DONNA: Yeah.
DONNA: Yes.
DONNA: You dont have to leave.
DONNA: You must be Estelle.
DONNA: You told him how I like the commercial.
DOORMAN 2: And they think they're better than us?
DOORMAN 2: So, you didn't even watch the couch?
DOORMAN: ...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.
DOORMAN: Actually, it was her friend.
DOORMAN: Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?
DOORMAN: Benes? No-one here by that name.
DOORMAN: Excuse me.
DOORMAN: Excuse me.
DOORMAN: George Costanza.
DOORMAN: Help you?
DOORMAN: Hey, buddy.
DOORMAN: I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.
DOORMAN: I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world.
DOORMAN: It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. Here. Wear that.
DOORMAN: No. I was just messing with his head.
DOORMAN: Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.
DOORMAN: Oh, I see. On the sports page...
DOORMAN: Oh. House-sitting, mmm.
DOORMAN: Seinfeld friend. He says, call him Monday.
DOORMAN: Then watch the door for a minute, would you?
DOORMAN: There's a George Bonanza to see you.
DOORMAN: Very good, sir.
DOORMAN: Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package at the exact same time the couch was stolen.
DOORMAN: What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?
DOORMAN: Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.
DOORMAN: You got a problem with that?
DOORMAN: You really think you're better than me, don't you?!
DOORMAN: You wanna be friends?
DORIS: And I had the scampi.
DORIS: Better than Danny's.
DORIS: He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.
DORIS: Hello, hello.
DORIS: Hello, Jerry.
DORIS: Jack, we should go. It was nice meeting you.
DORIS: She's adorable.
DORIS: So they arrived safely.
DORIS: Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes.
DORIS: Was that delicious or what?
DORIS: What does he want from you?
DRIVER: Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!
DRIVER: Books, that's what you do?
DRIVER: Dag Gavershole Plaza huh? Pendant Publishing, that's books right? Miss?
DRIVER: Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.
DRIVER: Going deaf?
DRIVER: Have you got a cigarette?
DRIVER: Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Seles. Wasn't that something.
DRIVER: Hey what about a hearing aid?
DRIVER: Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!
DRIVER: Huh?
DRIVER: I didn't take your Chuckle, man!
DRIVER: I don't even like Chuckles!
DRIVER: I said you know what I do when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey uh do you make a book of Jumbles?
DRIVER: I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!
DRIVER: I told him I was gonna mess him up.
DRIVER: I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something.
DRIVER: I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes. I have to stop for gasoline.
DRIVER: Lady, could you move your head a little bit?
DRIVER: My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.
DRIVER: No! Impossible! It is on `Empty'!
DRIVER: No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it.
DRIVER: Oh I-I-I'm sorry.
DRIVER: Oh.
DRIVER: Pardon me sir?
DRIVER: Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!
DRIVER: Righteo
DRIVER: So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?
DRIVER: Sorry. Heh heh heh...
DRIVER: Where to?
DRIVER: Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior.
DRIVER: Yeah, I don't read much myself, well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, not me. You know what I do?
DRIVER: Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.
DRIVER: Yes this is 92
DRIVER: You with the tennis center?
DRIVER: Your head. I can't see out the back. Little more.. ..Little more. Thank you.
DRY CLEANE: Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing-
DRY CLEANER: I shrunk it.
DRY CLEANER: May I help you?
DRY CLEANER: Maybe you asked for it to be washed.
DRY CLEANER: When did you bring it in?
DRY CLEANER: Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?
DRY CLEANER: You got a receipt?
DRY CLEANER: You should get the receipt.
DUGAN: *You're* taking the job?
DUGAN: Cat-ty...
DUGAN: It's a, uh, washcloth.
DUGAN: Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.
DUGAN: Reer...
DUGAN: She walks like orangutan.
DUGAN: So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria...
DUGAN: That's Sam, the new girl in the counting.
DUGAN: You shouldn't make fun of pigs.
DUNCAN: But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already beaten you in Junior High School three times.
DUNCAN: Hi, George
DUNCAN: I know, you've been saying that for twenty years because you know you can't beat me. You couldn't beat me then and you can't beat me now.
DUNCAN: If he beats me, I'll not only give you a raise, I'll send you to Hawaii for two weeks.
DUNCAN: Jerry Seinfeld!
DUNCAN: Miss Stafford?
DUNCAN: No, I'm still not convinced and I never will be.
DUNCAN: Now you're going to see what kind of liar you're mixed up with.
DUNCAN: That's a good idea.
DUNCAN: That's what I've always wondered about.
DUNCAN: Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we Jerry? Gee I hope you're not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do.
DUSTIN: Tell him, Dustin says, Hello.
DWAYNE: All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us.
DWAYNE: All right, do you have a prescription?
DWAYNE: For what?
DWAYNE: Hey, you can't have that dog in here.
DWAYNE: No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.
DWAYNE: Oh hello Kramer.
DWAYNE: Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame.
DWAYNE: Out!
DWAYNE: Put that away!
DWAYNE: What about him?
DWAYNE: What are you doing?
DWAYNE: What are you talking about?
DWAYNE: What?
DWAYNE: Who said anything about a discount.
DWAYNE: Why should I give you a discount.
DWAYNE: Why?
DWAYNE: Yeah, we can do that.
DWAYNE: Yes...
DX: All right, Rula, its time to go.
EALINE: Hello?
EALINE: Mr. Peterman, I, uh...
EALINE: Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
EARL: Ah c'mon. Keep things interesting, pass the time.
EARL: Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight to Houston.
EARL: All right, but I wanna see some cash on the table.
EARL: All right, I'll give you a sportin' chance. I'll take Ithaca.
EARL: Any of 'em talk to you?
EARL: Come on, Mexico City!
EARL: David Berkowitz.
EARL: Double or nothin'.
EARL: Earl Hafler, nice to meet you. I'm headed to Houston, where you headed?
EARL: Friendly wager.
EARL: How 'bout 200?
EARL: I should have quitted at double or nothin'. Travelers checks acceptable?
EARL: Okay, Cosmo, we're back in business. Let's check out the board. Now, who do you like?
EARL: Pretty good.
EARL: See you around, Cosmo.
EARL: So it's a mailbag, so what?
EARL: This could be Mexico City.
EARL: Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200... Will that be cash or check?
EARL: Well, that Newman was your good luck charm.
EARL: What about the plane in Ithaca?
EARL: Where did you get this?
EARL: You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Hafler.
EARL: Your buddy's a helluva guy.
EARL: Your friend caused the delay?
ECHO: hello
ED: 9:15?
ED: And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?
ED: But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.
ED: Can I shower?
ED: Go to hell!
ED: Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!
ED: I brought a brown sweater.
ED: I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.
ED: I'll never make it.
ED: I've got a bag of cashews in there.
ED: It's Eddie.
ED: My brown sweater.
ED: My brown sweater.
ED: My shoes. You packed my shoes.
ED: That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.
ED: The kitchen.
ED: We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.
ED: What are you doing?!
ED: What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.
ED: Where's my sweater?
ED: Who do you think you're talking to, pal?
EDDIE: Cool.
EDDIE: Dewy meadow.
EDDIE: Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes.
EDDIE: I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.
EDDIE: I don't want to talk about it.
EDDIE: I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really liked me, and then things kind of cooled off.
EDDIE: I'm ready.
EDDIE: It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a skull.
EDDIE: That's right.
EDDIE: Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.
EDDIE: Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish.
EDDIE: Well, I'm not married to it.
EDDIE: You wanted to see me?
EDDIT: It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't be dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts.
EGO: Yeah, you heard of 'em?
ELAIEN: No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
ELAIEN: Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face.
ELAIEN: Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
ELAINE : He said hed give me a lift.
ELAINE : Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
ELAINE AND JERRY: Hey!

ELAINE: 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back.
ELAINE: 'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
ELAINE: 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
ELAINE: 'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
ELAINE: 'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. Right? Am I right? Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. Oh, you got a little, uh...
ELAINE: 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
ELAINE: 'Cos I'm not in the mood.
ELAINE: 'Kay.
ELAINE: 'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
ELAINE: 'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'

ELAINE: ....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas.
ELAINE: ...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
ELAINE: ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!

ELAINE: ...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
ELAINE: ...Kramer.

ELAINE: ...Well, obviously... You know... Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
ELAINE: ...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
ELAINE: ..And then there were three.

ELAINE: Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
ELAINE: Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, Would you SHUT UP?! I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people.
ELAINE: Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons......entrate.

ELAINE: Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.

ELAINE: Ah! I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, I'm there for you.
ELAINE: AH! I've got it.

ELAINE: Ah, I didn't know who he was!
ELAINE: Ah, I know. I know...!
ELAINE: Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
ELAINE: Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.

ELAINE: Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
ELAINE: Ah, I'm ready what?

ELAINE: Ah, you don't have to tell me.
ELAINE: Ah, you don't know anything. You see, I don't know anything, means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said You're crazy.

ELAINE: Ah.
ELAINE: Ah.
ELAINE: Ah.

ELAINE: Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
ELAINE: Aha ha ha
ELAINE: Aha hu, You look *terrific*.
ELAINE: Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
ELAINE: Aha.
ELAINE: Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
ELAINE: Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
ELAINE: Ahem. 646? What is this?
ELAINE: Ahh ... wait till you hear this.
ELAINE: Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
ELAINE: Ahh, yeah, sure.
ELAINE: Ahh-cnee.
ELAINE: Ahh.
ELAINE: Ahh.
ELAINE: AHhh. Thank you.
ELAINE: Ahhhhh
ELAINE: Ahhhhhh haa ha ha
ELAINE: Ahum!
ELAINE: Albano is your last name.
ELAINE: Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
ELAINE: Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...

ELAINE: All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
ELAINE: All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?

ELAINE: All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
ELAINE: All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
ELAINE: All right, but I'm running out of purses here.
ELAINE: All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
ELAINE: All right, ha ha
ELAINE: All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
ELAINE: All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.

ELAINE: All right, let's just forget it.
ELAINE: All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later.
ELAINE: All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
ELAINE: All right, pile it on.
ELAINE: All right, see you later.
ELAINE: All right, sir.
ELAINE: All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
ELAINE: All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
ELAINE: All right, that's all I wanted to know.
ELAINE: All right, that's it. How do you spell your last name?
ELAINE: All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. she took her own Life..
ELAINE: All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
ELAINE: All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
ELAINE: All right, we're done here.
ELAINE: All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? Even you can't keep that up.

ELAINE: All right. Let's go, to Reggies.
ELAINE: All right. Spill it, Jerome.
ELAINE: All right. Take it easy.
ELAINE: All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
ELAINE: All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
ELAINE: All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
ELAINE: All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
ELAINE: All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office.
ELAINE: All right. Whiff away.
ELAINE: All right. Witness? .
ELAINE: All rightee.
ELAINE: All shell think is that you like her.
ELAINE: All time.
ELAINE: Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
ELAINE: Almost.
ELAINE: Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
ELAINE: Alright thats it! Were back together!
ELAINE: Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!!
ELAINE: Alright, alright.

ELAINE: Alright, here you go, choke on it .
ELAINE: Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
ELAINE: Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
ELAINE: Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
ELAINE: Alright, I'm heading over right now.
ELAINE: Alright, Im out of here.
ELAINE: Alright, let's do it.
ELAINE: Alright, let's go, come on.
ELAINE: Alright, let's go.
ELAINE: Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
ELAINE: Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
ELAINE: Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
ELAINE: Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
ELAINE: Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
ELAINE: Alright, okay. You talk to him.
ELAINE: Alright, send him up here.
ELAINE: Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
ELAINE: Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
ELAINE: Alright, that's enough of this.
ELAINE: Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
ELAINE: Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.
ELAINE: Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
ELAINE: Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
ELAINE: Alright, well, I'll just take them back.
ELAINE: Alright, well, I'll see ya.
ELAINE: Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
ELAINE: Alright, well, now that's something..
ELAINE: Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
ELAINE: Alright, well...
ELAINE: Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
ELAINE: Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
ELAINE: Alright--would you just put her on?
ELAINE: Alright.
ELAINE: Alright.
ELAINE: Alright.
ELAINE: Alright.
ELAINE: Alright.
ELAINE: Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
ELAINE: Alright. Forget it!
ELAINE: Alright. Goodnight.
ELAINE: Alright. I can't go.
ELAINE: Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
ELAINE: Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
ELAINE: Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
ELAINE: Alrighty, bye.
ELAINE: Although one wonders if War and Peace would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title War---What Is It Good For?
ELAINE: Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
ELAINE: Always a pleasure to see you.
ELAINE: Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
ELAINE: Am I? Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
ELAINE: An accident? What happened?
ELAINE: An addict? Well, it just keeps getting better!
ELAINE: An Armani suit?
ELAINE: An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
ELAINE: An IQ test.
ELAINE: And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
ELAINE: And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
ELAINE: And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
ELAINE: And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
ELAINE: And he's dunking!
ELAINE: And he's growing it in just for me. It's mine. It's all mine.
ELAINE: And he's has a bit of a rash.
ELAINE: And he's saying  I wish I was taller ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
ELAINE: and here.
ELAINE: And I asked him, Should Jerry bring anything?
ELAINE: And I could just be there. For you.
ELAINE: And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
ELAINE: And I said I hadn't seen her.
ELAINE: And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs.
ELAINE: And Ill be right upstairs?
ELAINE: And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
ELAINE: And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
ELAINE: And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
ELAINE: And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
ELAINE: And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*
ELAINE: And scuba diving.
ELAINE: And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
ELAINE: And that would be good.
ELAINE: And the bathroom in your apartment?
ELAINE: And the bush-women.
ELAINE: And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
ELAINE: And then he starts writing on my chart.
ELAINE: And then you flush.
ELAINE: And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
ELAINE: And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
ELAINE: And vodka.
ELAINE: And what times the funeral?
ELAINE: And you get along well with women.
ELAINE: And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
ELAINE: And you stopped by just to give it to me?
ELAINE: And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
ELAINE: And you're taking...
ELAINE: And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
ELAINE: And... hes hilarious.
ELAINE: And... what would those be?
ELAINE: And?
ELAINE: Andre?
ELAINE: Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
ELAINE: Anna...
ELAINE: Answering machine.
ELAINE: Any other time.
ELAINE: Anybody here? Peterboy?
ELAINE: anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
ELAINE: Anything else?
ELAINE: Anything else? What do you mean anything else?
ELAINE: Anything getting through? Bob?
ELAINE: Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
ELAINE: Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
ELAINE: Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
ELAINE: Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby.
ELAINE: Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
ELAINE: Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
ELAINE: Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland.
ELAINE: Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?
ELAINE: Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
ELAINE: Anyway, so how was the dinner?
ELAINE: Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
ELAINE: Anyway...they're real.
ELAINE: Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
ELAINE: Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
ELAINE: Are the clubs there?
ELAINE: Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
ELAINE: Are we still going to the movies tonight?
ELAINE: Are you
ELAINE: Are you actually considering this?
ELAINE: Are you alright?
ELAINE: Are you calling me a liar?
ELAINE: Are you coming with me?
ELAINE: Are you doing new material?
ELAINE: Are you going down?
ELAINE: Are you happy now?
ELAINE: are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony, I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
ELAINE: Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
ELAINE: Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
ELAINE: Are you OK? What? What?
ELAINE: Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?
ELAINE: Are you okay?
ELAINE: Are you out of your mind?!
ELAINE: Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it?
ELAINE: Are you serious?
ELAINE: Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
ELAINE: Are you sure you want to do that?
ELAINE: Are you sure you want us here for this?
ELAINE: Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
ELAINE: Are you sure?
ELAINE: Are you sure?
ELAINE: Are you?
ELAINE: Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
ELAINE: Aren't you Raquel Welch?
ELAINE: Aren't you too young to be bitter?
ELAINE: Aren't you?
ELAINE: Argh.. Fleas How did you get fleas?
ELAINE: Arghhh, look it's a fire!
ELAINE: Arrive?
ELAINE: Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
ELAINE: Artie Shaw. Honeysuckle Jump.
ELAINE: As long as you don't put...
ELAINE: As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
ELAINE: Ask about your arm.
ELAINE: Ask Jerry.
ELAINE: Ask your mother, you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
ELAINE: Astro...naut!
ELAINE: At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
ELAINE: At least it wasn't atomic.
ELAINE: At the Knights of Columbus?
ELAINE: At the movies.
ELAINE: At work?
ELAINE: At Yankee Stadium?
ELAINE: augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
ELAINE: Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
ELAINE: Aw, Glenn.
ELAINE: Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
ELAINE: Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
ELAINE: Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
ELAINE: Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
ELAINE: Aww, nuts!
ELAINE: Aww.
ELAINE: Aww. Sold out.
ELAINE: Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...
ELAINE: Babs?
ELAINE: Babu Bhatt did it.
ELAINE: Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?
ELAINE: Backless? Ya gonna back her in?
ELAINE: Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
ELAINE: Balloon bouquet? For who?
ELAINE: Bark.
ELAINE: Be down in a minute.
ELAINE: Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
ELAINE: Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
ELAINE: Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
ELAINE: Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
ELAINE: Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.
ELAINE: Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
ELAINE: Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting.
ELAINE: Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
ELAINE: Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
ELAINE: Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
ELAINE: Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
ELAINE: Because I was gooood.
ELAINE: Because I'm a *woman*. Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
ELAINE: Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
ELAINE: Because it's insane?
ELAINE: Because it's really nobody's business.
ELAINE: Because it's rude, otherwise.
ELAINE: Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
ELAINE: because of the gum
ELAINE: Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
ELAINE: Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
ELAINE: Because they're turning your teeth green?
ELAINE: Because we're adults?
ELAINE: Because you have an attitude.
ELAINE: Because! Because she missed her period!
ELAINE: Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
ELAINE: Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
ELAINE: Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
ELAINE: Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
ELAINE: Because, it is what she does.
ELAINE: Because, it's discriminatory
ELAINE: Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
ELAINE: Because... Yeah?
ELAINE: Been a while?
ELAINE: Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
ELAINE: Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
ELAINE: Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
ELAINE: Bernie is dead, you moron! Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? Ugh!
ELAINE: Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?
ELAINE: Better call the zoo.
ELAINE: Better, now.
ELAINE: Between a peck and a make out.
ELAINE: Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
ELAINE: Binaca?
ELAINE: Bizarro Jerry?
ELAINE: Bizarro world..
ELAINE: Black Forrest?
ELAINE: Blaine!?
ELAINE: Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
ELAINE: Bob!
ELAINE: Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
ELAINE: Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? All right, here we go. Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
ELAINE: Boing! Hehe hehe.
ELAINE: Boogey?
ELAINE: Book it.
ELAINE: Books, Jerry.
ELAINE: Bore-ing.
ELAINE: Both of the them.
ELAINE: Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. Really.
ELAINE: Bouchard's, on 53rd.
ELAINE: Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
ELAINE: Boy, he takes such a long time.
ELAINE: Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
ELAINE: Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
ELAINE: Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
ELAINE: Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
ELAINE: Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
ELAINE: Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
ELAINE: Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
ELAINE: Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
ELAINE: Boys are sick.
ELAINE: Bravo!
ELAINE: Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
ELAINE: Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
ELAINE: Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
ELAINE: Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
ELAINE: Brett?
ELAINE: Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
ELAINE: Brett? Everything alright?
ELAINE: Bummer...Okay, good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
ELAINE: Burma.
ELAINE: Burma?
ELAINE: Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
ELAINE: But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
ELAINE: But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
ELAINE: But he used a condom, right?
ELAINE: But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
ELAINE: But he's okay?
ELAINE: But he's so small.
ELAINE: But I didn't do anything.
ELAINE: But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
ELAINE: But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
ELAINE: But I got my own note.
ELAINE: But I really did like it
ELAINE: But I really enjoy dancing.
ELAINE: But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
ELAINE: But I wanted to see the bushmen.
ELAINE: But I, I can't go alone!
ELAINE: But it was in pen. You fake erase.
ELAINE: But it's a line from that song!
ELAINE: But it's cold out.
ELAINE: But it's got a pee-stain on it.
ELAINE: But it's Saturday.
ELAINE: But last night you said you were free!
ELAINE: But she broke up with you.
ELAINE: But she was fifteen.
ELAINE: But that's why I got you the tighter ones!
ELAINE: But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
ELAINE: But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
ELAINE: But we need you.
ELAINE: But we were here ahead of you.
ELAINE: But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
ELAINE: but what else did they say
ELAINE: But what??
ELAINE: But why? Why can't you do it?
ELAINE: But why? Why don't you want to?
ELAINE: But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
ELAINE: But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
ELAINE: But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
ELAINE: But you lied first.
ELAINE: But you said it was in the store!.
ELAINE: But you said no more painting.
ELAINE: But you were!!
ELAINE: But, Jake, I didn't...
ELAINE: But, that didn't happen to you.
ELAINE: But, what is the comment.
ELAINE: But...Jake...
ELAINE: Buzz me.
ELAINE: By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
ELAINE: By marriage.
ELAINE: Bye
ELAINE: Bye bye
ELAINE: Bye bye oh.. George wait wait

ELAINE: Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
ELAINE: Do it like this. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
ELAINE: Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
ELAINE: Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
ELAINE: Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
ELAINE: Do you have an apple or anything?
ELAINE: Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
ELAINE: Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
ELAINE: Do you have to?
ELAINE: Do you have twenty bucks?
ELAINE: Do you hear something?
ELAINE: Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
ELAINE: Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!

ELAINE: Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
ELAINE: Do you realize what youre saying?
ELAINE: Do you see it or don't you?
ELAINE: Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
ELAINE: Do you smell something?
ELAINE: Do you think I should call him and apologize?
ELAINE: Do you think it's a coincidence?
ELAINE: Do you think of anything?..
ELAINE: Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.

ELAINE: Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
ELAINE: Don't be ridiculous! I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
ELAINE: Don't be ridiculous.
ELAINE: Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
ELAINE: Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
ELAINE: Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
ELAINE: Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
ELAINE: Don't say that!
ELAINE: Don't worry, I...
ELAINE: Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
ELAINE: Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
ELAINE: Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
ELAINE: Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
ELAINE: Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
ELAINE: Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
ELAINE: Donna Chang?
ELAINE: Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?

ELAINE: Good. so far: Newman and Kramer are using a USPS mail truck to run deposit bottles and cans to Michigan, in order to collect 10 cents on each of them. George has been given an assignment by Mr Wilhelm, but he hasn't a clue what it is. Elaine outbids Sue-Ellen Mishke at an auction, to buy John F Kennedy's golf clubs on behalf of Mr Peterman, and leaves them in the back of Jerry's car. Kramer and Newman have left groceries under the hood of Jerry's car, meaning Jerry has to take it to Tony the mechanic, who loves the car more than Jerry does. When Jerry asks for his car back, Tony flees in it, taking JFK's clubs with him.
ELAINE: Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.

ELAINE: Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
ELAINE: Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
ELAINE: Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.

ELAINE: Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
ELAINE: Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?
ELAINE: Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this: Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on David Letterman and the Tonight Show and he did a pilot for NBC called Jerry ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
ELAINE: Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?

ELAINE: Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
ELAINE: Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
ELAINE: Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!

ELAINE: Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
ELAINE: Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?

ELAINE: Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
ELAINE: Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
ELAINE: Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
ELAINE: Hey, let me ask you a question.
ELAINE: Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
ELAINE: Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
ELAINE: Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
ELAINE: Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.

ELAINE: Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!
ELAINE: Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
ELAINE: Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
ELAINE: Hey, Puddy.
ELAINE: Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
ELAINE: Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
ELAINE: Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
ELAINE: Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
ELAINE: Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry.
ELAINE: Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
ELAINE: Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
ELAINE: Hey, wake up. It's 8:30 you were supposed to walk me up at 7:15.
ELAINE: Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
ELAINE: Hey, we told you not to park there!
ELAINE: Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
ELAINE: Hey, What are you doing out here?
ELAINE: Hey, what are you doing?

ELAINE: Hey, what's going on?
ELAINE: Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.
ELAINE: Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
ELAINE: Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
ELAINE: Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
ELAINE: Hey, where's Kramer?
ELAINE: Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
ELAINE: Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
ELAINE: Hey, working out?
ELAINE: Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
ELAINE: Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
ELAINE: Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
ELAINE: Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
ELAINE: Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
ELAINE: Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
ELAINE: Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
ELAINE: Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.

ELAINE: I am never gonna fall asleep.
ELAINE: I am not buying a computer from you.
ELAINE: I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. Oh, look at that!

ELAINE: I am not calling you Jerry the Great.

ELAINE: I am not qualified to run the catalog!
ELAINE: I am not your pal.

ELAINE: I am speechless. I am without speech.
ELAINE: I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
ELAINE: I am up for anything.
ELAINE: I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
ELAINE: I am?
ELAINE: I am?
ELAINE: I am? But that's so sick.
ELAINE: I attend to his personal affairs.
ELAINE: I beg to differ.

ELAINE: I brought you chicken soup. Is that real fur?
ELAINE: I can be very clever.
ELAINE: I can cancel.
ELAINE: I can find out.
ELAINE: I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
ELAINE: I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
ELAINE: I can't believe he hasn't called.
ELAINE: I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
ELAINE: I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
ELAINE: I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
ELAINE: I can't believe she's walking around in that.
ELAINE: I can't believe this!
ELAINE: I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
ELAINE: I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
ELAINE: I can't believe we broke up like that.
ELAINE: I can't believe what's going on out here.
ELAINE: I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! When did I say hi?
ELAINE: I can't believe you left your post.
ELAINE: I can't believe you said that.
ELAINE: I can't believe you ski!
ELAINE: I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.

ELAINE: I can't kick you out of your bed.
ELAINE: I can't say that.
ELAINE: I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
ELAINE: I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
ELAINE: I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
ELAINE: I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
ELAINE: I can't take your bedroom.
ELAINE: I can't tell you.
ELAINE: I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
ELAINE: I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
ELAINE: I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
ELAINE: I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
ELAINE: I can't. I'm the best man.
ELAINE: I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
ELAINE: I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
ELAINE: I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
ELAINE: I cannot believe this!
ELAINE: I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
ELAINE: I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. Gimme a break.
ELAINE: I cant remember.
ELAINE: I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
ELAINE: I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
ELAINE: I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
ELAINE: I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
ELAINE: I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
ELAINE: I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
ELAINE: I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
ELAINE: I cut it.
ELAINE: I dance fine.
ELAINE: I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
ELAINE: I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
ELAINE: I did not jaywalk.
ELAINE: I did.
ELAINE: I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
ELAINE: I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
ELAINE: I did. Uh...
ELAINE: I did?
ELAINE: I didn't get it.
ELAINE: I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
ELAINE: I didn't hear anything.
ELAINE: I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
ELAINE: I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
ELAINE: I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
ELAINE: I didn't know you SMOKED.
ELAINE: I didn't know you were getting me a note.
ELAINE: I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
ELAINE: I didn't pay attention.
ELAINE: I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
ELAINE: I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
ELAINE: I didn't say anything.
ELAINE: I didn't say anything.
ELAINE: I didn't say it.
ELAINE: I didn't take your napkins.
ELAINE: I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
ELAINE: I didnt get that joke either.
ELAINE: I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
ELAINE: I do have one teeny little problem, though.
ELAINE: I do now.
ELAINE: I do to.
ELAINE: I do.
ELAINE: I do.
ELAINE: I don't believe this woman.
ELAINE: I don't believe this.
ELAINE: I don't blame ya'
ELAINE: I don't buy it.
ELAINE: I don't care for jewellery on men
ELAINE: I don't care:
ELAINE: I don't eat Oreos.
ELAINE: I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
ELAINE: I don't fool around, baby!
ELAINE: I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
ELAINE: I don't have a boyfriend.
ELAINE: I don't have a fax machine.
ELAINE: I don't know - it just is.
ELAINE: I don't know about that.
ELAINE: I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
ELAINE: I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
ELAINE: I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
ELAINE: I don't know if I can.
ELAINE: I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
ELAINE: I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there: Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head. But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
ELAINE: I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
ELAINE: I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said I've never seen you looser.
ELAINE: I don't know!
ELAINE: I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
ELAINE: I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know what to do. Oh god.... so how was the movie?
ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
ELAINE: I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
ELAINE: I don't know, I guess.
ELAINE: I don't know, I have to think about it. I need a nonpartisan mirror.
ELAINE: I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
ELAINE: I don't know, maybe.
ELAINE: I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know.
ELAINE: I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
ELAINE: I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
ELAINE: I don't know. Chuck it?
ELAINE: I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
ELAINE: I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
ELAINE: I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
ELAINE: I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
ELAINE: I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
ELAINE: I don't know. It's a building.
ELAINE: I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
ELAINE: I don't know. Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
ELAINE: I don't know. Nina. Nina! I'm gonna go grab a bite.
ELAINE: I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
ELAINE: I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
ELAINE: I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. Jerry? Je... Hello?
ELAINE: I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
ELAINE: I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
ELAINE: I don't know. What do you think?
ELAINE: I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
ELAINE: I don't know...a year?
ELAINE: I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
ELAINE: I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
ELAINE: I don't like this, it is to easy.
ELAINE: I don't like to talk during a massage.
ELAINE: I don't mind skunk.
ELAINE: I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
ELAINE: I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
ELAINE: I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
ELAINE: I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
ELAINE: I don't think we should be talking about this.
ELAINE: I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
ELAINE: I don't understand.
ELAINE: I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
ELAINE: I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
ELAINE: I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
ELAINE: I don't wanna!
ELAINE: I don't want it.
ELAINE: I don't want soup. I can make my own soup.  5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery.
ELAINE: I don't want to keep him waiting...
ELAINE: I don't want to see her naked.
ELAINE: I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it!
ELAINE: I don, t think so.
ELAINE: I dont care, Im not hungry.
ELAINE: I dont have five thousand dollars.
ELAINE: I dont know what your parents did to you.
ELAINE: I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
ELAINE: I dont know.
ELAINE: I dont know.
ELAINE: I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
ELAINE: I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
ELAINE: I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
ELAINE: I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
ELAINE: I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
ELAINE: I dont think so David, were through.
ELAINE: I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
ELAINE: I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
ELAINE: I dropped a grape.
ELAINE: I dunno, at least three weeks.
ELAINE: I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
ELAINE: I dunno.
ELAINE: I dunno.
ELAINE: I dunno.
ELAINE: I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
ELAINE: I faked it.
ELAINE: I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
ELAINE: I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
ELAINE: I found it!
ELAINE: I gave him an ultimatum.
ELAINE: I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine captain.
ELAINE: I got a date.
ELAINE: I got a note from my gynecologist.
ELAINE: I got a pebble.
ELAINE: I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing and strutting in front of their store for two days.
ELAINE: I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
ELAINE: I got him a two-line phone.
ELAINE: I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
ELAINE: I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!

ELAINE: I got what you asked.
ELAINE: I gotta go return something...
ELAINE: I gotta go talk to him.
ELAINE: I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
ELAINE: I gotta go.
ELAINE: I gotta gooo...
ELAINE: I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
ELAINE: I gotta split.
ELAINE: I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
ELAINE: I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
ELAINE: I guess I'll just--
ELAINE: I guess I'm... Lois Loan.
ELAINE: I guess it was just a matter of time.
ELAINE: I guess it's you, Jer.
ELAINE: I guess she didn't think it was funny.
ELAINE: I guess this one is my fault.
ELAINE: I guess we could've called for help.
ELAINE: I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
ELAINE: I guess.
ELAINE: I guess.
ELAINE: I guess.
ELAINE: I guess.
ELAINE: I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
ELAINE: I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
ELAINE: I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
ELAINE: I had no idea you had this kind of money.
ELAINE: I had this dream last night and you were in it.
ELAINE: I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
ELAINE: I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
ELAINE: I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
ELAINE: I had to take it again.
ELAINE: I hate it!!
ELAINE: I hate the counter.
ELAINE: I hate the good ones.
ELAINE: I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
ELAINE: I hate this.
ELAINE: I have a good masseuse you could go to.
ELAINE: I have a personal commitment.
ELAINE: I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out?
ELAINE: I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
ELAINE: I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
ELAINE: I have no idea.
ELAINE: I have to go to the bathroom too
ELAINE: I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
ELAINE: I have to live in a cave.
ELAINE: I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
ELAINE: I hear ya, Sister.
ELAINE: I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
ELAINE: I heard him contend that.
ELAINE: I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.
ELAINE: I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
ELAINE: I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
ELAINE: I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
ELAINE: I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
ELAINE: I just didn't know you watched that.
ELAINE: I just don't enjoy being with him.
ELAINE: I just don't get it.
ELAINE: I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
ELAINE: I just finished working out are you busy?
ELAINE: I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
ELAINE: I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
ELAINE: I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
ELAINE: I just met him this morning.
ELAINE: I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
ELAINE: I just said the same thing to you.
ELAINE: I just thought I could write it.
ELAINE: I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
ELAINE: I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
ELAINE: I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
ELAINE: I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
ELAINE: I kinda like her.
ELAINE: I knew it! You're a regifter!
ELAINE: I knew those condoms were defective!
ELAINE: I know he belches a lot.
ELAINE: I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
ELAINE: I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
ELAINE: I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
ELAINE: I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
ELAINE: I know I know. That is so ahh ......
ELAINE: I know that but why are you going?
ELAINE: I know that look.
ELAINE: I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
ELAINE: I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
ELAINE: I know!
ELAINE: I know!
ELAINE: I know! Can you imagine that?
ELAINE: I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
ELAINE: I know, but he does.
ELAINE: I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
ELAINE: I know, he's so tiny!
ELAINE: I know, I don't want......kids.
ELAINE: I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
ELAINE: I know, I know, I was unbelievable
ELAINE: I know, I know, this is it.
ELAINE: I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
ELAINE: I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
ELAINE: I know, it's just something you have to say...
ELAINE: I know, it's not that.
ELAINE: I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
ELAINE: I know--
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know.
ELAINE: I know. I need a lesson.
ELAINE: I know. I woke up with this.
ELAINE: I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
ELAINE: I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
ELAINE: I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
ELAINE: I lied
ELAINE: I like coffee.
ELAINE: I Like Her!
ELAINE: I like Julie. She's very personable.
ELAINE: I like Witchy Woman.
ELAINE: I like your little bag.
ELAINE: I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
ELAINE: I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
ELAINE: I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
ELAINE: I love Cajun cooking.
ELAINE: I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
ELAINE: I love it. I'm getting it.
ELAINE: I love shrimp! I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, and I will eat it until my stomach pops! Oh..
ELAINE: I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
ELAINE: I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
ELAINE: I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
ELAINE: I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
ELAINE: I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
ELAINE: I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
ELAINE: I mean, I can't give people orders!
ELAINE: I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
ELAINE: I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
ELAINE: I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
ELAINE: I mean, stranger things have happened...
ELAINE: I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
ELAINE: I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
ELAINE: I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
ELAINE: I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
ELAINE: I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
ELAINE: I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
ELAINE: I met him.
ELAINE: I might be Elaine.
ELAINE: I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
ELAINE: I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
ELAINE: I need some space.
ELAINE: I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
ELAINE: I need something to read on the subway.
ELAINE: I need those clubs.
ELAINE: I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
ELAINE: I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
ELAINE: I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
ELAINE: I needed to move a bureau.
ELAINE: I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
ELAINE: I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
ELAINE: I never saw anyone play like that.
ELAINE: I never saw the statue.
ELAINE: I never should have given Anna the impression--
ELAINE: I never told you his name.
ELAINE: I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
ELAINE: I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
ELAINE: I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
ELAINE: I picked up his mail while he was on the road
ELAINE: I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta be out by the end of the month.
ELAINE: I put her stats on the back.
ELAINE: I realize that.
ELAINE: I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
ELAINE: I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
ELAINE: I really like the city.
ELAINE: I really think it's the size of your neck.
ELAINE: I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
ELAINE: I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
ELAINE: I respect that. Mmm, what happened?
ELAINE: I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
ELAINE: I said I'll take care of it!
ELAINE: I said I'm sorry.
ELAINE: I said it.
ELAINE: I said rubber fire.
ELAINE: I said, All Right.
ELAINE: I said, Do you wanna go upstairs?
ELAINE: I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
ELAINE: I said, yeah.
ELAINE: I said: So, what do you think?. And he said, Gabardine?. And I said, Yeah. That was it.
ELAINE: I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
ELAINE: I say, it's a peach.
ELAINE: I see you're still sticking with the denim. Do you have that card that I gave you?
ELAINE: I should have never left him alone.
ELAINE: I should never have made that phone call.
ELAINE: I should..
ELAINE: I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
ELAINE: I smell cherry.
ELAINE: I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
ELAINE: I staked out his health club.
ELAINE: I still don't see what the big deal is.
ELAINE: I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
ELAINE: I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
ELAINE: I still smell!
ELAINE: I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
ELAINE: I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
ELAINE: I talked with the groom's parents..
ELAINE: I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
ELAINE: I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
ELAINE: I think he does too
ELAINE: I think he emphasized would.
ELAINE: I think he's got ideas.
ELAINE: I think I can tell.
ELAINE: I think I might.
ELAINE: I think I'll let you do it.
ELAINE: I think I'm gonna be sick.
ELAINE: I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
ELAINE: I think it would be romantic.
ELAINE: I think it's a mistake.
ELAINE: I think it's B.O.!
ELAINE: I think it's great. I think you should get it.
ELAINE: I think it's OK.
ELAINE: I think it's unconscionable.
ELAINE: I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
ELAINE: I think she'd figure it out.
ELAINE: I think so.
ELAINE: I think they might be real.
ELAINE: I think they went out to dinner.
ELAINE: I think they're laboring.
ELAINE: I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
ELAINE: I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
ELAINE: I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
ELAINE: I think you're sticking it to me.
ELAINE: I think your um ...
ELAINE: I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
ELAINE: I though I'd never find it.
ELAINE: I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
ELAINE: I thought all guys do that.
ELAINE: I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...
ELAINE: I thought George was meeting us here?
ELAINE: I thought he was deported.
ELAINE: I thought he was with you.
ELAINE: I thought I was alone.
ELAINE: I thought my idea was just as good.
ELAINE: I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
ELAINE: I thought she was the one.
ELAINE: I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
ELAINE: I thought that was pretty good, huh?
ELAINE: I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
ELAINE: I thought you had done this before.
ELAINE: I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
ELAINE: I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
ELAINE: I thought you were busy tonight.
ELAINE: I thought you were finished.
ELAINE: I thought you were hungry.
ELAINE: I thought you wore silk underwear.
ELAINE: I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
ELAINE: I told him I was busy.
ELAINE: I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
ELAINE: I told ya'. He has ideas.
ELAINE: I told ya.
ELAINE: I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
ELAINE: I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
ELAINE: I told you, I can't hear a word.
ELAINE: I touched 'em.
ELAINE: I tought you didn't like double dates.
ELAINE: I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
ELAINE: I turned him. He defected.
ELAINE: I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
ELAINE: I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
ELAINE: I want that free sub.
ELAINE: I want the one that I earned. I'll get it. I'll get it! H&H, and Elaine.
ELAINE: I want to be in on this, too.
ELAINE: I want to break up.
ELAINE: I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
ELAINE: I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time.
ELAINE: I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
ELAINE: I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
ELAINE: I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
ELAINE: I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
ELAINE: I was begging her please! please! she was insane
ELAINE: I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
ELAINE: I was just kiddin, around.......
ELAINE: I was just trying to help you.
ELAINE: I was on the other line talking to Jill.
ELAINE: I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? Ahh.
ELAINE: I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
ELAINE: I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
ELAINE: I was with David *Putty* last night.
ELAINE: I went out with a a friend.
ELAINE: I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
ELAINE: I went to visit him.
ELAINE: I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
ELAINE: I will never understand people.
ELAINE: I will!
ELAINE: I will.
ELAINE: I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
ELAINE: I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em.
ELAINE: I wish I could quit...
ELAINE: I wish I was dead.
ELAINE: I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
ELAINE: I wish.
ELAINE: I won't.
ELAINE: I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
ELAINE: I wonder what happened?
ELAINE: I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
ELAINE: I would love to go upstairs.
ELAINE: I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
ELAINE: I wouldn't be comfortable.
ELAINE: I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
ELAINE: I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
ELAINE: I wouldn't sign one.
ELAINE: I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
ELAINE: I'd rather not say.
ELAINE: I'd stick.
ELAINE: I'll bet they were even in on it.
ELAINE: I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
ELAINE: I'll catch it!
ELAINE: I'll get it.
ELAINE: I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
ELAINE: I'll go to Paris.
ELAINE: I'll have a cinnamon babka.
ELAINE: I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
ELAINE: I'll make a note of it.
ELAINE: I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
ELAINE: I'll pay for it.
ELAINE: I'll put in a good word for you.
ELAINE: I'll say.
ELAINE: I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
ELAINE: I'll see you later.
ELAINE: I'll see you tomorrow.
ELAINE: I'll see you.
ELAINE: I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
ELAINE: I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
ELAINE: I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
ELAINE: I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
ELAINE: I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
ELAINE: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
ELAINE: I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
ELAINE: I'll try and remember that. Where's my meal?
ELAINE: I'm *really* hungry!
ELAINE: I'm afraid of dogs now.
ELAINE: I'm fine.
ELAINE: I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
ELAINE: I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
ELAINE: I'm going down there.
ELAINE: I'm going in .
ELAINE: I'm going to go see Mel Tormé with him?
ELAINE: I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
ELAINE: I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
ELAINE: I'm going to order Chinese Food.
ELAINE: I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
ELAINE: I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
ELAINE: I'm going to that!
ELAINE: I'm gonna do a little firing.
ELAINE: I'm gonna faint...
ELAINE: I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist.
ELAINE: I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
ELAINE: I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
ELAINE: I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
ELAINE: I'm good.
ELAINE: I'm having people over.
ELAINE: I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
ELAINE: I'm in looove!
ELAINE: I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
ELAINE: I'm just thinking about the question.
ELAINE: I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
ELAINE: I'm kind of swamped.
ELAINE: I'm kinda off of him. Uh, outlet?
ELAINE: I'm looking for Kramer.
ELAINE: I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
ELAINE: I'm marchin' in.
ELAINE: I'm marchin'.
ELAINE: I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
ELAINE: I'm never eating here again.
ELAINE: I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
ELAINE: I'm not being superficial
ELAINE: I'm not below.
ELAINE: I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
ELAINE: I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
ELAINE: I'm not gonna sleep with you.
ELAINE: I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
ELAINE: I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
ELAINE: I'm not in the mood.
ELAINE: I'm not Jewish.
ELAINE: I'm not mad.
ELAINE: I'm not saying anything.
ELAINE: I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
ELAINE: I'm not surprised.
ELAINE: I'm not telling you.
ELAINE: I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
ELAINE: I'm okay, it's just a nip.
ELAINE: I'm plumb out.
ELAINE: I'm queen of the castle.
ELAINE: I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
ELAINE: I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
ELAINE: I'm really sorry, Noreen...
ELAINE: I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
ELAINE: I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one.
ELAINE: I'm so sorry George
ELAINE: I'm sorry but there's somebody else.
ELAINE: I'm sorry honey.
ELAINE: I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
ELAINE: I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. .
ELAINE: I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
ELAINE: I'm sorry you have to go.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, George, but it's true.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
ELAINE: I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
ELAINE: I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
ELAINE: I'm sorry... sorry.
ELAINE: I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
ELAINE: I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
ELAINE: I'm sure he was just joking around.
ELAINE: I'm sure it's right around here.
ELAINE: I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
ELAINE: I'm sure they're not.
ELAINE: I'm sure you could.
ELAINE: I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. Hold that thought!
ELAINE: I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
ELAINE: I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
ELAINE: I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
ELAINE: I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me.
ELAINE: I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
ELAINE: I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
ELAINE: I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
ELAINE: I'm very imPRESSED? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
ELAINE: I'm waiting.
ELAINE: I'm white.
ELAINE: I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
ELAINE: I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
ELAINE: I've always loved ... United Airlines.
ELAINE: I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
ELAINE: I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
ELAINE: I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
ELAINE: I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
ELAINE: I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
ELAINE: I've got a confession to make.
ELAINE: I've got an alarm, ok?
ELAINE: I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
ELAINE: I've got no room.
ELAINE: I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
ELAINE: I've got Super Bowl fever.
ELAINE: I've got that magazine article for you.
ELAINE: I've got to go
ELAINE: I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
ELAINE: I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
ELAINE: I've lost 6 pounds.
ELAINE: I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train.
ELAINE: I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says Well, this is as far as I can take you.
ELAINE: I've never seen her before.
ELAINE: I've never seen you jealous before.
ELAINE: I've touched mine!
ELAINE: I've yada yada'd sex.
ELAINE: I, I don't think so.
ELAINE: I, I think that's my button. You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
ELAINE: I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
ELAINE: I,...
ELAINE: I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
ELAINE: I...
ELAINE: I... hate that woman.
ELAINE: I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
ELAINE: I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
ELAINE: I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
ELAINE: I...I don't know...
ELAINE: I...touched...'em.
ELAINE: Idiots! This is all your fault!
ELAINE: If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
ELAINE: If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
ELAINE: If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
ELAINE: If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
ELAINE: If I was saying something I would have said it.
ELAINE: If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
ELAINE: If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
ELAINE: If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
ELAINE: If only.
ELAINE: If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
ELAINE: If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
ELAINE: If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
ELAINE: If you were a woman would you go out with him?
ELAINE: If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
ELAINE: Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
ELAINE: Ilene.
ELAINE: In about twenty minutes.
ELAINE: In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
ELAINE: In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
ELAINE: In the back.
ELAINE: In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
ELAINE: In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
ELAINE: In the office.
ELAINE: In them?!
ELAINE: India? Tst, Yeah, right. I'm goin' to India..
ELAINE: Insurance? You're charging me?
ELAINE: Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
ELAINE: Interesting.
ELAINE: Interracial? Us?
ELAINE: Is anything wrong?
ELAINE: Is George here?
ELAINE: Is he black..
ELAINE: Is he black?
ELAINE: Is he going to try to kiss me?
ELAINE: Is he happy?
ELAINE: Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
ELAINE: Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
ELAINE: Is it *real* butter?
ELAINE: Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
ELAINE: Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
ELAINE: is it?
ELAINE: Is she?
ELAINE: Is that good?
ELAINE: Is that something?
ELAINE: Is that something?
ELAINE: Is that the right word?
ELAINE: Is that the supermodel?
ELAINE: Is that tomorrow?
ELAINE: Is that with the parts and labor?
ELAINE: Is that..?
ELAINE: Is there a table ready?
ELAINE: Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
ELAINE: Is this gonna hurt?
ELAINE: Is this Noreen?
ELAINE: Isn't he the best?
ELAINE: Isn't it going the other way?
ELAINE: Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
ELAINE: Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
ELAINE: Isn't that a little racist?
ELAINE: Isn't that a little...rash?
ELAINE: Isn't that blue car him?
ELAINE: Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
ELAINE: Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
ELAINE: Isnt that...? Oh, is this from the snow last night? Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
ELAINE: It can be very frustrating.
ELAINE: It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
ELAINE: It could be very confusing.
ELAINE: It depends on who's going. Are you going?
ELAINE: It doesn't matter to me.
ELAINE: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one: race.
ELAINE: It doesn't matter.
ELAINE: It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
ELAINE: It ever happened! Understand?
ELAINE: It felt like a couple of levels.
ELAINE: It is funny.
ELAINE: It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
ELAINE: It is not necessary.
ELAINE: It is obtrusive, isn't it?
ELAINE: It is so forgotten.
ELAINE: It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
ELAINE: It is..
ELAINE: It isn't?
ELAINE: It looks exactly like me.
ELAINE: It looks good.
ELAINE: It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
ELAINE: It must be a mistake.
ELAINE: It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
ELAINE: It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
ELAINE: It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
ELAINE: It shrinks?
ELAINE: It smells like a rubber fire.
ELAINE: It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
ELAINE: It took him like ten seconds!
ELAINE: It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... Oh! This stinks! Oh, come on... come on...!...God!
ELAINE: It was a joke...
ELAINE: It was an accident!
ELAINE: It was an accident.
ELAINE: It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
ELAINE: It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
ELAINE: It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
ELAINE: It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
ELAINE: It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
ELAINE: It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
ELAINE: It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
ELAINE: It was..uh.. John-John.
ELAINE: It went in the sewer!
ELAINE: It works.
ELAINE: It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
ELAINE: It's a beautiful couch.
ELAINE: It's a classic.
ELAINE: It's a hair.
ELAINE: It's a long story.
ELAINE: It's a new area code.
ELAINE: It's a page number.
ELAINE: It's a peach.
ELAINE: It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
ELAINE: It's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
ELAINE: It's a tu-hur-bo.
ELAINE: It's almost stupid if we didn't.
ELAINE: It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
ELAINE: It's an un-vitation! Hey, are you gettin' taller?
ELAINE: It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
ELAINE: It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
ELAINE: It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
ELAINE: It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
ELAINE: It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
ELAINE: It's black, right?
ELAINE: It's BOOKED Jerry!
ELAINE: It's brown!
ELAINE: It's brug-wa .
ELAINE: It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
ELAINE: It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
ELAINE: It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
ELAINE: It's dancing.
ELAINE: It's disgusting.
ELAINE: it's Elaine
ELAINE: It's Elaine Marie Benes.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
ELAINE: It's for George.
ELAINE: It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
ELAINE: It's garbage.
ELAINE: It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
ELAINE: It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
ELAINE: It's his birthday and it's his last day?
ELAINE: It's invisible.
ELAINE: It's ironic.
ELAINE: It's Joe Mayo's coat.
ELAINE: It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
ELAINE: It's just a stupid movie.
ELAINE: It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
ELAINE: It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
ELAINE: It's Lainey!
ELAINE: It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
ELAINE: It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
ELAINE: It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.
ELAINE: It's locked..
ELAINE: It's me!
ELAINE: It's me, are you ready to go?
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me.
ELAINE: It's me? Isn't it a little premature?
ELAINE: It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
ELAINE: It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
ELAINE: It's not a purse. It's European.
ELAINE: It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
ELAINE: It's not an easy thing to bring up.
ELAINE: It's not bleak - it's springtime.
ELAINE: It's not just hair! Look!
ELAINE: It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
ELAINE: It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
ELAINE: It's not serious, is it?
ELAINE: It's not such a bad name.
ELAINE: It's nothing.
ELAINE: It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
ELAINE: It's PLO blend.
ELAINE: It's possible.
ELAINE: It's possible.
ELAINE: It's right over there.
ELAINE: It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
ELAINE: It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate.
ELAINE: It's supposed to feel good.
ELAINE: It's Susie.
ELAINE: It's that bad?
ELAINE: It's the next best thing to being alone.
ELAINE: It's the play button, off his VCR.
ELAINE: It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
ELAINE: It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
ELAINE: It's us.
ELAINE: It's Vegetable Lasagna.
ELAINE: It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
ELAINE: It's your house.
ELAINE: It's, ah, Asian-Americans.
ELAINE: It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
ELAINE: It, s, it's up to you.
ELAINE: It.
ELAINE: It.
ELAINE: It... works!
ELAINE: it?s me!
ELAINE: Its killing you isn?t it?
ELAINE: Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
ELAINE: Its disgusting.
ELAINE: Its Elaine.
ELAINE: Its great to... talk about... other people...
ELAINE: Its OK.
ELAINE: Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
ELAINE: Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
ELAINE: Its that bad?
ELAINE: Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
ELAINE: Its time you got outta here anyway.
ELAINE: Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
ELAINE: Id better not.
ELAINE: Id do it but I dont have any money.
ELAINE: Ill be right back.
ELAINE: Ill eat out.
ELAINE: Ill go if I dont have to talk.
ELAINE: Ill hang this phone up right now!
ELAINE: Ill see ya.
ELAINE: Ill take it!
ELAINE: Im doing great.
ELAINE: Im going to get some popcorn.
ELAINE: Im just curious.

ELAINE: Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
ELAINE: Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
ELAINE: Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
ELAINE: Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
ELAINE: Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
ELAINE: Jerry, do I stink?
ELAINE: Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
ELAINE: Jerry, George, what are you doing here?

ELAINE: Jerry, She looks exactly like you.
ELAINE: Jerry, talk to that guy again.
ELAINE: Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
ELAINE: Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
ELAINE: Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
ELAINE: Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
ELAINE: Jerry, the man is a doctor.
ELAINE: Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
ELAINE: Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.

ELAINE: Jerry, we don't have time for this...
ELAINE: Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
ELAINE: Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
ELAINE: Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
ELAINE: Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
ELAINE: Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
ELAINE: Jerry, you can barbecue back here.
ELAINE: Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
ELAINE: Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
ELAINE: Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.

ELAINE: Let's start the bidding.
ELAINE: Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
ELAINE: Like ...humm...How did she sound?
ELAINE: Like clams.
ELAINE: Like this...
ELAINE: Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
ELAINE: Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
ELAINE: Like you're a liar!
ELAINE: Like... Like this?
ELAINE: Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
ELAINE: Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
ELAINE: Listen to me you little shi........
ELAINE: Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
ELAINE: Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
ELAINE: Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
ELAINE: Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
ELAINE: Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
ELAINE: Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
ELAINE: Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
ELAINE: Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
ELAINE: Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
ELAINE: Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
ELAINE: Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
ELAINE: Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
ELAINE: Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
ELAINE: Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
ELAINE: Listen, was Russell at the casting?
ELAINE: Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
ELAINE: Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
ELAINE: Literally.
ELAINE: Lithe!
ELAINE: Lithe.
ELAINE: Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
ELAINE: Lloyd, yes. Hello.
ELAINE: Long day?
ELAINE: Look at George. He lucked out, huh?
ELAINE: Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
ELAINE: Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
ELAINE: Look at my fish... Is he...
ELAINE: Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
ELAINE: Look at that woman.
ELAINE: Look at this turnout.
ELAINE: Look at you. You're on a slant.
ELAINE: Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
ELAINE: Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
ELAINE: Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on.
ELAINE: Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
ELAINE: Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. OK, next showings at 9:00, we can't wait any longer.
ELAINE: Look out the window, you'll see.
ELAINE: Look what came in the mail today.
ELAINE: Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
ELAINE: Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
ELAINE: Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
ELAINE: Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
ELAINE: Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
ELAINE: Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
ELAINE: Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
ELAINE: Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
ELAINE: Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
ELAINE: Look, just because I'm a woman...
ELAINE: Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
ELAINE: Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
ELAINE: Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
ELAINE: Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
ELAINE: Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
ELAINE: Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
ELAINE: Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
ELAINE: Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends.
ELAINE: Look. We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. name names! Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
ELAINE: Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. I mean, it's a girl's bike.
ELAINE: Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
ELAINE: Lou! In here! We have to talk.
ELAINE: Love newton?
ELAINE: Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
ELAINE: Maestro huh? O.K.
ELAINE: Maestro!
ELAINE: Make it clear?
ELAINE: Make it ten.
ELAINE: Make it three hundred.
ELAINE: Makes you wonder, though, doesnt it?
ELAINE: Malaysia. I was in the area.
ELAINE: Malaysia?
ELAINE: Man, Hands?
ELAINE: Man, Kramer! I could kill him!
ELAINE: Manuscript?
ELAINE: Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
ELAINE: Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
ELAINE: Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
ELAINE: Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower.
ELAINE: Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
ELAINE: May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
ELAINE: Maybe coffee was coffee.
ELAINE: Maybe he likes her.
ELAINE: Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
ELAINE: Maybe I should just get married.
ELAINE: Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties and they're - all laid out for me.
ELAINE: Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
ELAINE: Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
ELAINE: Maybe it's the cold weather.
ELAINE: Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
ELAINE: Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
ELAINE: Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
ELAINE: Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
ELAINE: Maybe we could all have dinner later?
ELAINE: Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
ELAINE: Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
ELAINE: Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
ELAINE: Maybe.
ELAINE: Maybe.
ELAINE: Maybe.. All over your face!
ELAINE: Me either.
ELAINE: Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.
ELAINE: Me too
ELAINE: Me too.
ELAINE: Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
ELAINE: Me, either!
ELAINE: Me?
ELAINE: Me?
ELAINE: Me?
ELAINE: Me? Are you talking about me?
ELAINE: Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
ELAINE: Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
ELAINE: Me? Why me?
ELAINE: Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
ELAINE: Meh.
ELAINE: Melrose Place?
ELAINE: MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
ELAINE: Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
ELAINE: Milhouse.
ELAINE: Milk?
ELAINE: Mind? Oh o-of course not.
ELAINE: Missing?
ELAINE: Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined..

ELAINE: Mmmnn, Georgie!
ELAINE: Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
ELAINE: Moland?
ELAINE: Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
ELAINE: Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... Kramer!
ELAINE: Mr Lippman?
ELAINE: Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches, they only good for two weeks.
ELAINE: Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
ELAINE: Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
ELAINE: Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
ELAINE: Mr Peterman, you...
ELAINE: Mr Peterman. You're back.
ELAINE: Mr. Lippman, how are you?
ELAINE: Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, um--
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman.. I'm Susie.. She's me..
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman?
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman?
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?
ELAINE: Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt...
ELAINE: Mr. Pitt...
ELAINE: Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
ELAINE: Mrs. Oliver?
ELAINE: Mrs. Onassis's? That's hard to pronounce.
ELAINE: Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
ELAINE: Mrs. Winston?
ELAINE: Mulligatawny?
ELAINE: Must have been an accident...
ELAINE: Must wean.
ELAINE: My back hurts.
ELAINE: My back.
ELAINE: My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
ELAINE: My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
ELAINE: My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
ELAINE: My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
ELAINE: My father, really? I had no idea.
ELAINE: My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
ELAINE: My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
ELAINE: My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
ELAINE: My God, are you okay?

ELAINE: My pleasure.
ELAINE: My Puddy? But we broke up.
ELAINE: My roommate has Lyme disease.
ELAINE: My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel.
ELAINE: My, George this must have cost a fortune.
ELAINE: My, my father?
ELAINE: N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
ELAINE: Na.
ELAINE: Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
ELAINE: Nah it's nothing.
ELAINE: Nah! They're fake!
ELAINE: Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
ELAINE: Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
ELAINE: Nah, nah, it's on me. Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. I'll see you, okay?
ELAINE: Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
ELAINE: Nah, we just play defense.
ELAINE: Nana?
ELAINE: Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
ELAINE: Ned must have left it here.
ELAINE: Nedda?
ELAINE: Nelson.
ELAINE: Nervous?
ELAINE: Never been a big fan. Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know,  Scent Of A Woman. Who-ah! Who-ah!
ELAINE: Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
ELAINE: Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
ELAINE: New couch? Why?
ELAINE: New jeans?
ELAINE: Newman plays tennis?
ELAINE: News? What news?

ELAINE: No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
ELAINE: No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
ELAINE: No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
ELAINE: No I'll take my chances. Come on...
ELAINE: No I'm bringing cake!
ELAINE: No idea.
ELAINE: no it is not
ELAINE: No it isn't.
ELAINE: No it's not.
ELAINE: No its not. That really is true.
ELAINE: No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
ELAINE: No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
ELAINE: No Mister Peterman.
ELAINE: No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
ELAINE: No no - me first.
ELAINE: No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
ELAINE: No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen: You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
ELAINE: No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
ELAINE: No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
ELAINE: No no no no, it's just...
ELAINE: No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
ELAINE: No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
ELAINE: No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
ELAINE: No no no, they weren't here before.
ELAINE: No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
ELAINE: no no, ..
ELAINE: No no, I can't sit in the front row.
ELAINE: No no, I wanna go.
ELAINE: No no, I want to eat now!
ELAINE: No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
ELAINE: No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
ELAINE: No no, no no.
ELAINE: No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
ELAINE: No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
ELAINE: No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
ELAINE: No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number.
ELAINE: No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a hair on it.
ELAINE: No not quite.
ELAINE: No one.
ELAINE: No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
ELAINE: No problem.
ELAINE: No reason. Just wanna see you again.
ELAINE: No thanks!
ELAINE: No thanks.
ELAINE: No thanks.
ELAINE: No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
ELAINE: No thanks. Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
ELAINE: No that's the week after.
ELAINE: No there has got be a mistake.
ELAINE: No they don't.
ELAINE: No they don't.
ELAINE: NO time for folding.. I think that's it.
ELAINE: No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
ELAINE: No way!
ELAINE: No way.
ELAINE: No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
ELAINE: No you didn't.
ELAINE: No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores.
ELAINE: No!
ELAINE: No!
ELAINE: No!
ELAINE: No!
ELAINE: No!
ELAINE: No!
ELAINE: No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
ELAINE: No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
ELAINE: No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
ELAINE: No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
ELAINE: No! I won't be a party to this.
ELAINE: No! I won't!
ELAINE: No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
ELAINE: No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
ELAINE: No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
ELAINE: No! Jerry! Jerry!
ELAINE: No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
ELAINE: No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
ELAINE: No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
ELAINE: No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
ELAINE: No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
ELAINE: No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
ELAINE: No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
ELAINE: No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. Yes, this is my attorney.
ELAINE: No,
ELAINE: No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. I'm getting the hang of it.
ELAINE: No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
ELAINE: No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
ELAINE: No, actually, you're not being funny now.
ELAINE: No, Alec Berg.
ELAINE: No, because I slept with my back to him.
ELAINE: No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
ELAINE: No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
ELAINE: No, but I exercised that day.
ELAINE: No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, Boy, you're a lot of woman!
ELAINE: No, but that's one problem. Why?
ELAINE: No, but there was nobody sitting here...
ELAINE: No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em?
ELAINE: No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
ELAINE: No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
ELAINE: No, but... it is very nice to know.
ELAINE: No, Castro.
ELAINE: No, Chinese.
ELAINE: No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
ELAINE: No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
ELAINE: No, don't...
ELAINE: No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
ELAINE: No, George, this is the ticket-&lt;holders&gt; line.
ELAINE: No, get-get off my purse!
ELAINE: No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
ELAINE: No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
ELAINE: No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
ELAINE: No, he wants to torture me.
ELAINE: No, he's just neat.
ELAINE: No, he's not.
ELAINE: No, hes driving back to Maryland tonight.
ELAINE: No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
ELAINE: No, I can't.
ELAINE: No, I didn't hear anything. Oh, my God, look who's here.
ELAINE: No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
ELAINE: No, I don't think so.
ELAINE: No, I don't want the man either.
ELAINE: No, I don't want this anymore.
ELAINE: No, I don't.
ELAINE: No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games!
ELAINE: No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
ELAINE: No, I got caught.
ELAINE: No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
ELAINE: No, I guess you couldn't have..
ELAINE: No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
ELAINE: No, I just have a cold.
ELAINE: No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
ELAINE: No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit.
ELAINE: No, I just..
ELAINE: No, I mentioned the bisk.
ELAINE: No, I need it.
ELAINE: No, I really don't want to.
ELAINE: No, I really don't.
ELAINE: No, I talked him into it.
ELAINE: No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
ELAINE: No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
ELAINE: No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
ELAINE: No, I'm not. Here you go.
ELAINE: No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
ELAINE: No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
ELAINE: No, I'm still working on it.
ELAINE: No, I'm sure you do.
ELAINE: No, I'm watching my weight.
ELAINE: No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
ELAINE: No, it could get sexual.
ELAINE: No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
ELAINE: No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
ELAINE: No, it's from the store.
ELAINE: No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
ELAINE: No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
ELAINE: No, it's not going to work with this guy.
ELAINE: No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
ELAINE: No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
ELAINE: No, Ill be seeing you. Good morning, good morning.. Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
ELAINE: No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
ELAINE: No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
ELAINE: No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
ELAINE: No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
ELAINE: No, milk.
ELAINE: No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
ELAINE: No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
ELAINE: No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
ELAINE: No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
ELAINE: No, no no.
ELAINE: No, No that's my purse!
ELAINE: No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
ELAINE: No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
ELAINE: No, no, but I would like to hear it.
ELAINE: No, no, come on Michael!
ELAINE: No, no, come on. I guarantee it.
ELAINE: No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
ELAINE: No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
ELAINE: No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
ELAINE: No, no, I'll be back.
ELAINE: No, no, I'm leaving.
ELAINE: No, no, it does!
ELAINE: No, no, it's okay.
ELAINE: No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
ELAINE: No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
ELAINE: No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
ELAINE: No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
ELAINE: No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
ELAINE: No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
ELAINE: No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
ELAINE: No, no, no, I can cancel.
ELAINE: No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
ELAINE: No, no, no, no, no.
ELAINE: No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
ELAINE: No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
ELAINE: No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
ELAINE: No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
ELAINE: No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
ELAINE: No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
ELAINE: No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. this.
ELAINE: No, no, no. You give me your number.
ELAINE: No, no, not Putumayo.
ELAINE: No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
ELAINE: No, no, unfocus.
ELAINE: No, no.
ELAINE: No, no.
ELAINE: No, no.
ELAINE: No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
ELAINE: No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
ELAINE: No, no. Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.
ELAINE: No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
ELAINE: No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
ELAINE: No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
ELAINE: No, no. Im fine.
ELAINE: No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
ELAINE: No, no. Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
ELAINE: No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
ELAINE: No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
ELAINE: No, no. Not friends.
ELAINE: No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. I just, I know you feel what I feel.
ELAINE: No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
ELAINE: No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
ELAINE: No, No...
ELAINE: No, No...
ELAINE: No, No....Yesss!!!!!!
ELAINE: No, not at all...
ELAINE: No, nothing.
ELAINE: No, of course not.
ELAINE: No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God!
ELAINE: No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.
ELAINE: No, really.
ELAINE: No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
ELAINE: No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
ELAINE: No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
ELAINE: No, sir, I can't.
ELAINE: No, still Sharon!
ELAINE: No, that'd be too noisy.
ELAINE: No, that's not it!
ELAINE: No, that's not your coat.
ELAINE: No, thats a big coincidence.
ELAINE: No, thats too much money to borrow.
ELAINE: No, the Green Lantern.
ELAINE: No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
ELAINE: No, there are degrees of coincidences.
ELAINE: No, these are saved.
ELAINE: No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
ELAINE: No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
ELAINE: No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -
ELAINE: No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
ELAINE: No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
ELAINE: No, we just met...
ELAINE: No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
ELAINE: No, what?
ELAINE: No, who?
ELAINE: No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
ELAINE: No, you can't be trusted!
ELAINE: No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
ELAINE: No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, Quite a workout.
ELAINE: No, you look pale.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No.
ELAINE: No. A $29, 000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
ELAINE: No. A general guy.
ELAINE: No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
ELAINE: No. Do you ever think about it?
ELAINE: No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
ELAINE: No. He said I didn't need a shot.
ELAINE: No. I can't smell it.
ELAINE: No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
ELAINE: No. I don't want him looking.
ELAINE: No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
ELAINE: No. I'll just walk home.
ELAINE: No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
ELAINE: No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
ELAINE: No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
ELAINE: No. In what way?
ELAINE: No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
ELAINE: No. Let me see that. Don't-mess-with-Johnny.
ELAINE: No. Me neither.
ELAINE: No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
ELAINE: No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
ELAINE: No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
ELAINE: No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
ELAINE: No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
ELAINE: No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
ELAINE: No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
ELAINE: No. Second choice.
ELAINE: No. She died.
ELAINE: No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
ELAINE: No. Suze! I mean, Suzie! Suzanne! Suzanna. Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
ELAINE: No. Today's *your* lucky day.
ELAINE: No. We were both in the mood for one.
ELAINE: No. What about him?
ELAINE: No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
ELAINE: No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say get out of here. I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
ELAINE: No. Why would you think that?
ELAINE: No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
ELAINE: No. You can wrap it. Kramer, are you still in there?
ELAINE: No. You got the wrong number, kid.
ELAINE: No. Your.
ELAINE: No....Oh No....
ELAINE: No?
ELAINE: No?
ELAINE: No?
ELAINE: Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
ELAINE: Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
ELAINE: Noo!
ELAINE: Noo, thanks.
ELAINE: Nooo, the other thing.
ELAINE: Nooo.
ELAINE: Noooo.
ELAINE: Noooooooooooo!
ELAINE: Nope.
ELAINE: Nope.
ELAINE: Nope.
ELAINE: Nope. What are you doing?
ELAINE: Noreen, are you crying?
ELAINE: Noreen, were you hitting on him?
ELAINE: Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
ELAINE: Not bad huh?
ELAINE: Not getting along?
ELAINE: Not good. I'm a moron.
ELAINE: Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
ELAINE: Not so good.
ELAINE: Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this today.
ELAINE: Not the pommel horse?
ELAINE: Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
ELAINE: Not, my Tim Whatley?
ELAINE: Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
ELAINE: Nothing has changed. How did this happen? Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
ELAINE: Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
ELAINE: Nothing, and I've looked.
ELAINE: Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...
ELAINE: Nothing, nothing.
ELAINE: Nothing, nothing.
ELAINE: Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
ELAINE: Nothing.
ELAINE: Nothing.
ELAINE: Nothing.
ELAINE: Nothing.
ELAINE: Nothing. He walked me home.
ELAINE: Nothing. I didn't say anything.
ELAINE: Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
ELAINE: Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
ELAINE: Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
ELAINE: Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head.
ELAINE: Nothing... Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
ELAINE: Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
ELAINE: Now listen, promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
ELAINE: Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
ELAINE: Now look what you've done.
ELAINE: Now look, don't take too long.
ELAINE: Now those look good, they're very bold.
ELAINE: Now what was that?
ELAINE: Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
ELAINE: Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
ELAINE: Now?!
ELAINE: Nowhere.
ELAINE: Nuthin'. Then he took me home.
ELAINE: O, your being auditted? What for?
ELAINE: O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
ELAINE: O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
ELAINE: O.k. Hold on just a second.
ELAINE: O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
ELAINE: O.K. O.K. Remy.
ELAINE: O.K. Thanks.
ELAINE: O.K. You start. What's your first choice?
ELAINE: O.K., can I just watch the show? God, what an asshole.
ELAINE: O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
ELAINE: Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
ELAINE: Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
ELAINE: Of course I hear that.
ELAINE: Of course I support your decision to change your name.
ELAINE: Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
ELAINE: Of course Id pay you back..
ELAINE: Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
ELAINE: Of course there's a community.
ELAINE: Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
ELAINE: Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
ELAINE: Of course, Mr Peterman.
ELAINE: Of course.
ELAINE: Of Vincent's picks?
ELAINE: Of what?
ELAINE: Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
ELAINE: Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
ELAINE: Oh
ELAINE: Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
ELAINE: Oh . Is this tooth chipped?
ELAINE: Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.
ELAINE: Oh are you?!
ELAINE: Oh Bob! Bob!
ELAINE: Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
ELAINE: Oh c'mon, Newman.
ELAINE: Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
ELAINE: Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
ELAINE: Oh come on.
ELAINE: Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
ELAINE: Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
ELAINE: Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
ELAINE: Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
ELAINE: Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
ELAINE: Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
ELAINE: Oh George, there's a space right there!
ELAINE: Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
ELAINE: Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
ELAINE: Oh god this tastes terrible.
ELAINE: Oh god! Oh, god. Kramer!
ELAINE: Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
ELAINE: Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
ELAINE: Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
ELAINE: Oh god, that guy's terrible.
ELAINE: Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?
ELAINE: Oh god.
ELAINE: Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
ELAINE: Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. You wouldn't believe it.
ELAINE: Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
ELAINE: Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
ELAINE: Oh good.
ELAINE: Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
ELAINE: Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
ELAINE: Oh great, thanks Kramer.
ELAINE: Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
ELAINE: Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. George.
ELAINE: Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
ELAINE: Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
ELAINE: Oh hi, Sue Ellen.
ELAINE: Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
ELAINE: Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
ELAINE: Oh I did?
ELAINE: Oh I didn't tell anyone.
ELAINE: Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
ELAINE: Oh I gotta start taking these stupid warnings more seriously.
ELAINE: oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
ELAINE: Oh is that so.
ELAINE: Oh it be. You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
ELAINE: Oh it was such a great night.
ELAINE: Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
ELAINE: Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
ELAINE: Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
ELAINE: Oh it's you.
ELAINE: Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.
ELAINE: Oh Jerry, dont blow this for me.
ELAINE: Oh Kramer.
ELAINE: Oh Kramer... The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted!
ELAINE: Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
ELAINE: Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
ELAINE: Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
ELAINE: Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
ELAINE: Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
ELAINE: Oh man, hes nuts.
ELAINE: Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
ELAINE: Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
ELAINE: Oh man. Ugh..
ELAINE: Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
ELAINE: Oh Man... Uunh.
ELAINE: Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
ELAINE: Oh my God!
ELAINE: Oh my god!
ELAINE: Oh my God! It's all over the test!
ELAINE: Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
ELAINE: Oh my God! That's my nipple.
ELAINE: Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
ELAINE: Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
ELAINE: Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
ELAINE: Oh my god, where is it?
ELAINE: Oh my God.
ELAINE: Oh my God.
ELAINE: Oh my God.
ELAINE: Oh my God.
ELAINE: Oh my God.
ELAINE: Oh my god.
ELAINE: Oh my god.
ELAINE: Oh my god.
ELAINE: Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
ELAINE: Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
ELAINE: Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
ELAINE: Oh my God. You're crying.
ELAINE: Oh my god..
ELAINE: Oh my!
ELAINE: Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
ELAINE: Oh no, lets do it now.
ELAINE: Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
ELAINE: Oh no, thank you.
ELAINE: Oh no.
ELAINE: Oh no.
ELAINE: Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
ELAINE: Oh no. What?
ELAINE: Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies: anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
ELAINE: Oh please no more.
ELAINE: Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
ELAINE: Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?
ELAINE: Oh please.. It's in the vault.
ELAINE: Oh quite.
ELAINE: Oh really, you like 'em?
ELAINE: Oh really?
ELAINE: Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
ELAINE: Oh really? The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
ELAINE: Oh right here
ELAINE: Oh she's fat?
ELAINE: Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew!
ELAINE: Oh Thanks, thank you very much.
ELAINE: Oh That'll do!
ELAINE: Oh that's a nice store.
ELAINE: Oh that's cute!
ELAINE: Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny: These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
ELAINE: Oh that's origi-
ELAINE: Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, Back in , or Good Vertibrations.
ELAINE: Oh Tomorrow...?
ELAINE: Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
ELAINE: Oh uh uh...
ELAINE: Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
ELAINE: oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
ELAINE: Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
ELAINE: Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
ELAINE: Oh ya.
ELAINE: Oh yeah! Jimmy.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
ELAINE: Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that? guy.
ELAINE: oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
ELAINE: Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. Really, really great!
ELAINE: Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, sure. Gimme a break.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
ELAINE: Oh yeah, the curse toast.
ELAINE: Oh yeah.
ELAINE: Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.
ELAINE: Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
ELAINE: Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
ELAINE: Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
ELAINE: Oh yeah. There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
ELAINE: Oh yeah?
ELAINE: Oh yeah? Can I see it?
ELAINE: Oh yeah? How'd you do?
ELAINE: Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
ELAINE: Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
ELAINE: Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
ELAINE: Oh!
ELAINE: Oh!
ELAINE: Oh!
ELAINE: Oh!
ELAINE: Oh!
ELAINE: Oh!
ELAINE: Oh! boy.
ELAINE: Oh! Do tell sir?
ELAINE: Oh! Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
ELAINE: Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me.

ELAINE: Oh, he's not on drugs.
ELAINE: Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
ELAINE: Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
ELAINE: Oh, he's...he's a joy...
ELAINE: Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
ELAINE: Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.

ELAINE: Oh, how disappointed you must have been.
ELAINE: Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.
ELAINE: Oh, how's the baby?
ELAINE: Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
ELAINE: Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my Atomic Sub card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
ELAINE: Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
ELAINE: Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
ELAINE: Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't remember them.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't think that's possible.
ELAINE: Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
ELAINE: Oh, I dont know..
ELAINE: Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
ELAINE: Oh, I know the type.
ELAINE: Oh, I know! It is awful!
ELAINE: Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
ELAINE: Oh, I love cashmere.
ELAINE: Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
ELAINE: Oh, I missed you!
ELAINE: Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
ELAINE: Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
ELAINE: Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
ELAINE: Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
ELAINE: Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
ELAINE: Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. Hi.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm not very good.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm not, uh...
ELAINE: Oh, I'm so sorry.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry. I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question.
ELAINE: Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
ELAINE: Oh, it stinks.
ELAINE: Oh, it was a frame-up.
ELAINE: Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it.
ELAINE: Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.
ELAINE: Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
ELAINE: Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
ELAINE: Oh, it's been a while.
ELAINE: Oh, it's been done to death.
ELAINE: Oh, Jeffrey.
ELAINE: Oh, Jerry!
ELAINE: Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
ELAINE: Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
ELAINE: Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
ELAINE: Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion.
ELAINE: Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
ELAINE: Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
ELAINE: Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
ELAINE: Oh, let me get the door for you. Ooh, be careful!
ELAINE: Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
ELAINE: Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
ELAINE: Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
ELAINE: Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
ELAINE: Oh, lovely.
ELAINE: Oh, Maestro.
ELAINE: Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The O went from the valet's B, to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
ELAINE: Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
ELAINE: Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
ELAINE: Oh, me too.
ELAINE: Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
ELAINE: Oh, mine's Ike.
ELAINE: Oh, Mm mm.. I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things.
ELAINE: Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
ELAINE: Oh, Mr Lippman. That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
ELAINE: Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
ELAINE: Oh, Mr. Peterman.
ELAINE: Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
ELAINE: Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
ELAINE: Oh, my God
ELAINE: Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
ELAINE: Oh, my God.

ELAINE: Oh, my stop. Bye-bye.

ELAINE: Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
ELAINE: Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast.
ELAINE: Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
ELAINE: Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! Crazy for feelings...
ELAINE: Oh, no! Come on Jerry.
ELAINE: Oh, no! I thought--
ELAINE: Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
ELAINE: Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
ELAINE: Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
ELAINE: Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.
ELAINE: Oh, no, I-I don't think so.
ELAINE: Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
ELAINE: Oh, no, it's okay.
ELAINE: Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
ELAINE: Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... Oh, you got *cookies*!
ELAINE: Oh, no.
ELAINE: Oh, no. Don't!
ELAINE: Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
ELAINE: Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
ELAINE: Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
ELAINE: Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
ELAINE: Oh, no...that won't last.
ELAINE: Oh, nothin'.
ELAINE: Oh, nothing for me. I'm going to Atomic Sub later.
ELAINE: Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
ELAINE: Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
ELAINE: Oh, of course it does.

ELAINE: Oh, OK, see you later.
ELAINE: Oh, okay, go ahead.
ELAINE: Oh, okay.
ELAINE: Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
ELAINE: Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
ELAINE: Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
ELAINE: Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
ELAINE: Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
ELAINE: Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
ELAINE: Oh, Please.
ELAINE: Oh, please.
ELAINE: Oh, please.
ELAINE: Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.
ELAINE: Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
ELAINE: Oh, probably caught in traffic.
ELAINE: Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
ELAINE: Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
ELAINE: Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
ELAINE: Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
ELAINE: Oh, right.
ELAINE: Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
ELAINE: Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. Hey, look at naked people.
ELAINE: Oh, right...I forgot.
ELAINE: Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
ELAINE: Oh, see you tomorrow morning.

ELAINE: Oh, so---so that's it?
ELAINE: Oh, sorry. Hello?

ELAINE: Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that Atomic Sub card.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, sure.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah. What's that called?
ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?
ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
ELAINE: Oh, yeah...

ELAINE: Oh, yeah?
ELAINE: Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. Mr. Pitt!

ELAINE: Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
ELAINE: Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
ELAINE: Oh, you know what? He got engaged.
ELAINE: Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
ELAINE: Oh, you want one?
ELAINE: Oh, you were?
ELAINE: Oh, you'll be playing ...
ELAINE: Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
ELAINE: Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.

And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.

ELAINE: See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
ELAINE: See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
ELAINE: See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
ELAINE: See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
ELAINE: See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
ELAINE: See, what did I tell ya?
ELAINE: See, yeah, that's all I was saying.
ELAINE: See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.

ELAINE: So now Duncan is back?
ELAINE: So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
ELAINE: So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.

So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me: Do you wanna split a cab uptown? And I said, Sure - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! So, then, he says to me, Where do you live? And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building.

ELAINE: So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes!
ELAINE: So when are we gonna eat?
ELAINE: So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
ELAINE: So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
ELAINE: So where are we staying?
ELAINE: So where do you get this note?
ELAINE: So where do you wanna eat?
ELAINE: So who's playing Elaine?
ELAINE: So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
ELAINE: So you cant do both?

ELAINE: So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
ELAINE: So you know, ... he called me.
ELAINE: So you say.
ELAINE: So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
ELAINE: So you're concerned.
ELAINE: So you're giving him a discount too?
ELAINE: So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
ELAINE: So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
ELAINE: So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
ELAINE: So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
ELAINE: So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
ELAINE: So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
ELAINE: So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
ELAINE: So, George... did you get the chair?
ELAINE: So, get this: Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
ELAINE: So, guess who called me.
ELAINE: So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, Do you date moving men?
ELAINE: So, he's...
ELAINE: So, how did it end?
ELAINE: So, how is a guy like you not involved?
ELAINE: So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
ELAINE: So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
ELAINE: So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
ELAINE: So, I haven't seen you in a while.
ELAINE: So, I understand youre moving to Phoenix?
ELAINE: So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
ELAINE: So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
ELAINE: So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
ELAINE: So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
ELAINE: So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
ELAINE: So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
ELAINE: So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
ELAINE: So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
ELAINE: So, its the same thing.
ELAINE: So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
ELAINE: So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
ELAINE: So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
ELAINE: So, she fell?
ELAINE: So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
ELAINE: So, that's the situation.
ELAINE: So, thats why were not together anymore.
ELAINE: So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
ELAINE: So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
ELAINE: So, the only reason ...
ELAINE: So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
ELAINE: So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
ELAINE: So, this is your little... love nest?
ELAINE: So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
ELAINE: So, waddya' going to do?
ELAINE: So, we're going out Friday.
ELAINE: So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
ELAINE: So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
ELAINE: So, what are you saying?
ELAINE: So, what d'you think?
ELAINE: So, what did he do?
ELAINE: So, what did you say?
ELAINE: So, what do you think?
ELAINE: So, what's that?
ELAINE: So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
ELAINE: So, whatd she say?
ELAINE: So, when're you getting back from Florida?
ELAINE: So, where's Todd?
ELAINE: So, will I see you later tonight?
ELAINE: So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
ELAINE: So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
ELAINE: So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
ELAINE: So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
ELAINE: So, you think you're sponge-worthy?
ELAINE: So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
ELAINE: So, you weren't born here?
ELAINE: So, you're gonna get a new couch?
ELAINE: So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
ELAINE: So.
ELAINE: So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
ELAINE: So. What is she?
ELAINE: So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?
ELAINE: So... impudent.
ELAINE: So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
ELAINE: So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
ELAINE: So?
ELAINE: So?
ELAINE: So?
ELAINE: So?
ELAINE: So?
ELAINE: So?
ELAINE: So?
ELAINE: So? How was it?
ELAINE: So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
ELAINE: So? Then what?
ELAINE: So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
ELAINE: So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
ELAINE: So? What do you want me to do about it?
ELAINE: So? What happened?
ELAINE: So? What happened?
ELAINE: So? What'd they say?
ELAINE: So? Where were you?!
ELAINE: Softer.
ELAINE: Some corn.
ELAINE: Some dinner, huh?
ELAINE: Some friend of his from England.
ELAINE: Some house, huh?
ELAINE: Some night, huh?
ELAINE: Some ugly baby, huh?
ELAINE: Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
ELAINE: Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
ELAINE: Someone I know!
ELAINE: Someone I know.
ELAINE: Someone left the door open.
ELAINE: something.. wrong?
ELAINE: Somethings going on here.
ELAINE: Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
ELAINE: Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
ELAINE: Sooo, how was your date?
ELAINE: Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
ELAINE: Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
ELAINE: Sorry.
ELAINE: Sorry.
ELAINE: Sorry. Hello?
ELAINE: Sorry. Somebody...help us!
ELAINE: Soup's not all that good anyway.
ELAINE: South Africa.
ELAINE: Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
ELAINE: Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
ELAINE: Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
ELAINE: Spite Never sleeps
ELAINE: Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
ELAINE: Sssshhhhhh!!!
ELAINE: Stabbed?!
ELAINE: Start smoking.
ELAINE: Statute.
ELAINE: Stay away from her.
ELAINE: Stay!
ELAINE: STELLA!
ELAINE: STELLA! STELLA!
ELAINE: Steve.
ELAINE: Stick ... with the opposite.
ELAINE: Stickin' it!
ELAINE: Still a 31 waist?
ELAINE: Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. By myself.
ELAINE: Still?
ELAINE: Stop _ the _ fight!
ELAINE: Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
ELAINE: Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
ELAINE: Street toughs took my armoire?
ELAINE: Stunned by soup?
ELAINE: Su-sie?
ELAINE: Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
ELAINE: Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
ELAINE: Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
ELAINE: Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
ELAINE: Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
ELAINE: Superman can go back in time?
ELAINE: Sure - the video.
ELAINE: Sure!
ELAINE: Sure, fine.
ELAINE: Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
ELAINE: Sure, sure.
ELAINE: Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
ELAINE: Sure. Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
ELAINE: Suuuuuuuuuuze!
ELAINE: Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
ELAINE: Swan Lake, at the Met.
ELAINE: Sweater.
ELAINE: Take a guess.
ELAINE: Take care of yourselves.
ELAINE: Take it away.
ELAINE: Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!
ELAINE: Televising opera?
ELAINE: Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
ELAINE: Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
ELAINE: Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle: polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
ELAINE: Tell me!
ELAINE: Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
ELAINE: Tell Ping I said hello.
ELAINE: Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
ELAINE: Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
ELAINE: Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
ELAINE: Ten minutes.
ELAINE: Terrific.
ELAINE: Thank god I found you..
ELAINE: Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
ELAINE: Thank you very much.
ELAINE: Thank you very much.
ELAINE: Thank you, Jackie.
ELAINE: Thank you, Julie.
ELAINE: Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
ELAINE: Thank you.
ELAINE: Thank you.
ELAINE: Thank you. ha ha ha ha.
ELAINE: Thank you. Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
ELAINE: Thank you. Ow!
ELAINE: Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
ELAINE: Thank you...aah, hm mm.
ELAINE: Thank-you.
ELAINE: Thanks
ELAINE: Thanks
ELAINE: Thanks a lot.
ELAINE: Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
ELAINE: Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
ELAINE: Thanks for the dinner.
ELAINE: Thanks for the re-fill.
ELAINE: Thanks.
ELAINE: Thanks. What.. what do you guys want..
ELAINE: That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
ELAINE: That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
ELAINE: That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
ELAINE: That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
ELAINE: That is it!
ELAINE: That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
ELAINE: That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
ELAINE: That is not the point.
ELAINE: That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
ELAINE: That is so ridiculous.
ELAINE: That is so stupid.
ELAINE: That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
ELAINE: That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?
ELAINE: That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
ELAINE: That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
ELAINE: That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
ELAINE: That seems about right.
ELAINE: That sounds urgent...
ELAINE: That was good. That was very good.
ELAINE: That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
ELAINE: That was nothing.
ELAINE: That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
ELAINE: That was so good.
ELAINE: That was two months ago.
ELAINE: That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
ELAINE: That will be fun.
ELAINE: That's a good idea.
ELAINE: That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
ELAINE: That's a pretty big tip...
ELAINE: That's a pretty girl.
ELAINE: That's at the airport, right?
ELAINE: That's because I thought you were black.
ELAINE: That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
ELAINE: That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
ELAINE: That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
ELAINE: That's fantastic.
ELAINE: That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
ELAINE: That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
ELAINE: That's good...
ELAINE: That's great George.
ELAINE: That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
ELAINE: That's her. That's her.
ELAINE: That's impossible...
ELAINE: That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
ELAINE: That's it. That's it. Stop right here.
ELAINE: That's it?
ELAINE: That's it?! That's the best you got?!
ELAINE: That's just about enough
ELAINE: That's just because your a jackass.
ELAINE: That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
ELAINE: That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
ELAINE: That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
ELAINE: that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
ELAINE: That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
ELAINE: That's not gonna do anything.
ELAINE: That's okay.
ELAINE: That's perfect!

ELAINE: Uhm, I just have a question.
ELAINE: Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
ELAINE: Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.

ELAINE: Um uh.
ELAINE: Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.

ELAINE: Um. Kramer!
ELAINE: Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
ELAINE: Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
ELAINE: Um...as far as I know.
ELAINE: Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.

ELAINE: Vincent. Where are you? I have to meet you.

ELAINE: We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
ELAINE: We found it. I can't believe it!
ELAINE: We get it.
ELAINE: We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
ELAINE: We have the same taste in movies.
ELAINE: We have to break up.
ELAINE: We have to replace the couch.
ELAINE: We just didn't think of you.
ELAINE: We just got along *so* great.
ELAINE: We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
ELAINE: We know the terrain.
ELAINE: We know what a face consists of.
ELAINE: We made plans.
ELAINE: We never dated in winter.
ELAINE: We should be able to get across right through here!
ELAINE: We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
ELAINE: We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
ELAINE: We talked about that already.
ELAINE: We try.
ELAINE: We used to date, but now we're just friends.
ELAINE: We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing youre gonna wait now?
ELAINE: We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
ELAINE: We were just trying to help.
ELAINE: We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
ELAINE: We'll have to sleep head to toe.
ELAINE: We'll see it Sunday.
ELAINE: We'll see.
ELAINE: We're down here! Help!
ELAINE: We're engaged?
ELAINE: We're going out tomorrow night.
ELAINE: We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
ELAINE: We're just, you know, having a good time.
ELAINE: We're not going to sit together?
ELAINE: We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
ELAINE: We're not wilding.
ELAINE: We're straightening out?
ELAINE: We've got a good team.
ELAINE: We, there are always a few.
ELAINE: We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
ELAINE: We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
ELAINE: Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
ELAINE: Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
ELAINE: Well
ELAINE: Well ...
ELAINE: Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......
ELAINE: Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
ELAINE: Well at least let George do it!
ELAINE: Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
ELAINE: Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
ELAINE: Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
ELAINE: Well come here and take a look.
ELAINE: Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
ELAINE: Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
ELAINE: Well do you have any in a... size four.?
ELAINE: Well do you see it or don't you?
ELAINE: Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
ELAINE: Well eh, kind of....
ELAINE: Well first we're going to a matinée, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see My Fair Lady and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
ELAINE: Well he frightened me.
ELAINE: Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
ELAINE: Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
ELAINE: Well how about a carrot cake?
ELAINE: Well I ...manuscript that I...
ELAINE: Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
ELAINE: Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
ELAINE: Well I didn't know.
ELAINE: Well I don't care. It was delicious.
ELAINE: Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
ELAINE: Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
ELAINE: well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
ELAINE: Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
ELAINE: Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know,, I got them tickets to the show.
ELAINE: Well I figured that's what couples do.
ELAINE: Well I have to interview a Mohel.
ELAINE: Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
ELAINE: Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
ELAINE: Well I trust people not to do that.
ELAINE: Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
ELAINE: Well I'm going to hell.
ELAINE: Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
ELAINE: Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
ELAINE: Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
ELAINE: Well I, I don't know.
ELAINE: Well if it's not a date then what is it?
ELAINE: Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
ELAINE: Well if you want it, you get it.
ELAINE: Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
ELAINE: Well it did occur to me.
ELAINE: Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
ELAINE: Well it was easy. Really.
ELAINE: Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
ELAINE: Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
ELAINE: Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
ELAINE: Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
ELAINE: Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
ELAINE: Well Jerry told me that you did.
ELAINE: Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
ELAINE: Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
ELAINE: Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
ELAINE: Well listen I'm going to do you want me to stop by?
ELAINE: Well maybe I feel the same way.
ELAINE: Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
ELAINE: Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
ELAINE: Well maybe you should ask him!
ELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.
ELAINE: Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
ELAINE: Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.
ELAINE: Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
ELAINE: Well some people drink coffee that late.
ELAINE: Well stop being such a baby.
ELAINE: Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up before they know what hit em.
ELAINE: Well that's not sex.
ELAINE: Well then what?
ELAINE: Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
ELAINE: Well they're perfectly edible.
ELAINE: Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
ELAINE: Well use a paper towel.
ELAINE: Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
ELAINE: Well we can take the car service from my office.
ELAINE: Well we could ...
ELAINE: Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier, people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
ELAINE: Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
ELAINE: Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
ELAINE: Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
ELAINE: Well what do you want to give him, change?
ELAINE: Well what happened when you raced him again?
ELAINE: Well what is this?
ELAINE: Well what, what about your fact-checking job?
ELAINE: Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
ELAINE: Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
ELAINE: Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
ELAINE: Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
ELAINE: Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city.
ELAINE: Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
ELAINE: Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
ELAINE: Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
ELAINE: Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
ELAINE: Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times.
ELAINE: Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
ELAINE: Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
ELAINE: Well,
ELAINE: Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... you dont want to go to... that... no.
ELAINE: Well, a lot of it is vegetable...
ELAINE: Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
ELAINE: Well, actually it's pretty grimy.
ELAINE: Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
ELAINE: Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
ELAINE: Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
ELAINE: Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
ELAINE: Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me big head.
ELAINE: Well, are you going to take a nap or --
ELAINE: Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this involuntarily movement. Some sort of a spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
ELAINE: Well, at least you're not bitter.
ELAINE: Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
ELAINE: Well, come on we're on vacation.
ELAINE: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
ELAINE: Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
ELAINE: Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
ELAINE: Well, did he say that?
ELAINE: Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
ELAINE: Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
ELAINE: Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
ELAINE: Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
ELAINE: Well, Fred asked me out.
ELAINE: Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.
ELAINE: Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
ELAINE: Well, go, go.
ELAINE: Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
ELAINE: Well, have they called the police yet?
ELAINE: Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
ELAINE: Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
ELAINE: Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
ELAINE: Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
ELAINE: Well, he looks like a man.
ELAINE: Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! So hows everything going over here?
ELAINE: Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
ELAINE: Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
ELAINE: Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
ELAINE: Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
ELAINE: Well, he's not a baseball player.
ELAINE: Well, Here we are.
ELAINE: Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
ELAINE: Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
ELAINE: Well, how are we gonna do it?
ELAINE: Well, how could he do that?
ELAINE: Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
ELAINE: Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
ELAINE: Well, I --
ELAINE: Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
ELAINE: Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
ELAINE: Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
ELAINE: Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
ELAINE: Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
ELAINE: Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
ELAINE: Well, I couldn't help it. Moland Spring?
ELAINE: Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
ELAINE: Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
ELAINE: Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
ELAINE: Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know about gold.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
ELAINE: Well, I felt a call for one.
ELAINE: Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
ELAINE: Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
ELAINE: Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
ELAINE: Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
ELAINE: Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
ELAINE: Well, I guess we'll just have - Ohh, just gimme that.
ELAINE: Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
ELAINE: Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. What?
ELAINE: Well, I have no intention of getting grace.
ELAINE: Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy.
ELAINE: Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
ELAINE: Well, I just came from the gym, unless I can shower at your place.
ELAINE: Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
ELAINE: Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
ELAINE: Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
ELAINE: Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
ELAINE: Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
ELAINE: Well, I should get going.. What are you doing?
ELAINE: Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...
ELAINE: Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
ELAINE: Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
ELAINE: Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
ELAINE: Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
ELAINE: Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
ELAINE: Well, I'll see ya...
ELAINE: Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
ELAINE: Well, I'm dating a communist.
ELAINE: Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
ELAINE: Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
ELAINE: Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
ELAINE: Well, I'm so sorry! I-
ELAINE: Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.
ELAINE: Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.
ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
ELAINE: Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
ELAINE: Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
ELAINE: Well, I, for one, really respect that.
ELAINE: Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
ELAINE: Well, I. I guess I been at Reggie's..
ELAINE: Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
ELAINE: Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
ELAINE: Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
ELAINE: Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
ELAINE: Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
ELAINE: Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
ELAINE: Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
ELAINE: Well, it's for my boss.
ELAINE: Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
ELAINE: Well, it's just one more day.
ELAINE: Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...
ELAINE: Well, it's just two hours by plane...
ELAINE: Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
ELAINE: Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
ELAINE: Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
ELAINE: Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
ELAINE: Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
ELAINE: Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
ELAINE: Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
ELAINE: Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
ELAINE: Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
ELAINE: Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
ELAINE: Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
ELAINE: Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
ELAINE: Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
ELAINE: Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
ELAINE: Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
ELAINE: Well, maybe.
ELAINE: Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
ELAINE: Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
ELAINE: Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
ELAINE: Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
ELAINE: Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
ELAINE: Well, no point in wasting $1, 200.
ELAINE: Well, no, I would hardly--
ELAINE: Well, nobody *told* me that!
ELAINE: Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
ELAINE: Well, one of those glasses.
ELAINE: Well, one of you better damn well take it!
ELAINE: Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
ELAINE: Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
ELAINE: Well, relationships are very important to me.
ELAINE: Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
ELAINE: Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
ELAINE: Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
ELAINE: Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
ELAINE: Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
ELAINE: Well, she has it!
ELAINE: Well, she wants you to like her.
ELAINE: Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
ELAINE: Well, so enjoy yourself. ha ha uh ha
ELAINE: Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
ELAINE: Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
ELAINE: Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.
ELAINE: Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
ELAINE: Well, thank you father.
ELAINE: Well, thank you Mr Peterman.
ELAINE: Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
ELAINE: Well, that is, that is strange.
ELAINE: Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
ELAINE: Well, that was fast!
ELAINE: Well, that'll get you goin' right there...
ELAINE: Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
ELAINE: Well, that's because you're an idiot.
ELAINE: Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
ELAINE: Well, that's your problem.
ELAINE: Well, that's...that's sweet.
ELAINE: Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
ELAINE: Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
ELAINE: Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
ELAINE: Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
ELAINE: Well, there's a doctor right here.
ELAINE: Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
ELAINE: Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
ELAINE: Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
ELAINE: Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
ELAINE: Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
ELAINE: Well, they're not kept in little cages.
ELAINE: Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
ELAINE: Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend.
ELAINE: Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
ELAINE: Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
ELAINE: Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
ELAINE: Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
ELAINE: Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
ELAINE: Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
ELAINE: Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
ELAINE: Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I, I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
ELAINE: Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
ELAINE: Well, uh, fan. My father--
ELAINE: Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
ELAINE: Well, uh, I'll cancel it.
ELAINE: Well, uhm... I...
ELAINE: Well, um, he, he got fired.
ELAINE: Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
ELAINE: Well, wait---wait a second.
ELAINE: Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
ELAINE: Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
ELAINE: Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
ELAINE: Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.

ELAINE: Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
ELAINE: Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go: Ahh. I mean every two seconds: Ahh. And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone: Ahh. I had to drop the class.

ELAINE: Yeah, it got pretty nasty.

ELAINE: Yeah, it's all taken care of.
ELAINE: Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.
ELAINE: Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
ELAINE: Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
ELAINE: Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.
ELAINE: Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
ELAINE: Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.

ELAINE: Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
ELAINE: Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
ELAINE: Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
ELAINE: Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.

ELAINE: Yeah. Definite moisture.
ELAINE: Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
ELAINE: Yeah. Hah.
ELAINE: Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
ELAINE: Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
ELAINE: Yeah. I better!
ELAINE: Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
ELAINE: Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
ELAINE: Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
ELAINE: Yeah. I know. Me, too.
ELAINE: Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
ELAINE: Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
ELAINE: Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
ELAINE: Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
ELAINE: Yeah. I'm invited.
ELAINE: Yeah. In fact, he....
ELAINE: Yeah. It is.
ELAINE: Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.
ELAINE: Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
ELAINE: Yeah. It's surprising.
ELAINE: Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
ELAINE: Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
ELAINE: Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. Yeah?
ELAINE: Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
ELAINE: Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
ELAINE: Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
ELAINE: Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
ELAINE: Yeah. Okay.
ELAINE: Yeah. Right.
ELAINE: Yeah. Right. Like that really matters.
ELAINE: Yeah. See that--
ELAINE: Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
ELAINE: Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
ELAINE: Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
ELAINE: Yeah. Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
ELAINE: Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
ELAINE: Yeah. That's him.
ELAINE: Yeah. That's right.
ELAINE: Yeah. That's what I just said.
ELAINE: Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
ELAINE: Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
ELAINE: Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.

ELAINE: Yeah. What, is it a problem?
ELAINE: Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
ELAINE: Yeah. Who sent you that one?
ELAINE: Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh.

ELAINE: Yeah. Yes it does...
ELAINE: Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
ELAINE: Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
ELAINE: Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
ELAINE: Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
ELAINE: Yeah. You're right.
ELAINE: Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
ELAINE: yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
ELAINE: Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?

ELAINE: Yes, his name is Hal.
ELAINE: Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.
ELAINE: Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
ELAINE: Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.
ELAINE: Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
ELAINE: Yes, I would say.
ELAINE: Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
ELAINE: Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
ELAINE: Yes, it's a must lie situation.
ELAINE: Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!

ELAINE: Yes, they can.
ELAINE: Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
ELAINE: Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.

ELAINE: Yes, yes!
ELAINE: Yes, yes, the one I didn't get.
ELAINE: Yes, yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes.
ELAINE: Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
ELAINE: Yes. He's one of those bounders.
ELAINE: Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
ELAINE: Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
ELAINE: Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
ELAINE: Yes. Who it this?
ELAINE: Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
ELAINE: Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
ELAINE: Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
ELAINE: Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see, Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
ELAINE: Yes?
ELAINE: Yessiree Bob.
ELAINE: Yi-yi-yi.
ELAINE: Yo.
ELAINE: You already ate?
ELAINE: You always break even.
ELAINE: You are amazing.
ELAINE: You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
ELAINE: You are kidding.
ELAINE: You are kidding. That is amazing. I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
ELAINE: You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
ELAINE: You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
ELAINE: You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
ELAINE: You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
ELAINE: You are!?!
ELAINE: You are?
ELAINE: You asked me to.
ELAINE: You be careful George.
ELAINE: You been enjoying them?
ELAINE: You better give me back that bike! Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
ELAINE: You can get a hot dog in the theater.
ELAINE: You can go.

ELAINE: You can still go.
ELAINE: You can tip a gardener.
ELAINE: You can't ask a person to change their name.
ELAINE: You can't be bleak in spring.
ELAINE: You can't beat a babka.
ELAINE: You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
ELAINE: You can't find beauty in a man?
ELAINE: You can't get one ring past him.
ELAINE: You can't let him get away with that!
ELAINE: you can't spare it??
ELAINE: You can't tell me?
ELAINE: You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
ELAINE: You can't! You can't do this now!
ELAINE: You can.
ELAINE: You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... Oh please!
ELAINE: You could have.
ELAINE: You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
ELAINE: You couldn't keep track of everybody?
ELAINE: You couldnt just give him one high-five?
ELAINE: You did didn't you.
ELAINE: You did enough.
ELAINE: You did.
ELAINE: You didn't bring a brown sweater.
ELAINE: You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
ELAINE: You didn't hear me buzzing?
ELAINE: You didn't know.
ELAINE: You didn't know.
ELAINE: You didn't say this to George, did you?
ELAINE: You didnt.
ELAINE: You ditched the fur?
ELAINE: You do?
ELAINE: You don't always smell someone from a drink.
ELAINE: You don't ask.. You tell.
ELAINE: You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
ELAINE: You don't have an old pair?
ELAINE: You don't have any furniture?
ELAINE: You don't have the label maker, do you?
ELAINE: You don't know?
ELAINE: You don't know?
ELAINE: You don't like her?
ELAINE: You don't like them?
ELAINE: You don't need us.
ELAINE: You don't respect my work at all, do you?
ELAINE: You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
ELAINE: You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
ELAINE: You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go I'll drive you over there. Come on.
ELAINE: You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
ELAINE: You doofus!
ELAINE: You encouraged her to get one.

ELAINE: You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6:00. No, make that six ideas by 4:00. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!

ELAINE: You heard me young lady, get in the car. And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
ELAINE: You heard me. Strip!
ELAINE: You just left? What did you tell her?
ELAINE: You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
ELAINE: You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
ELAINE: You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
ELAINE: you know
ELAINE: You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
ELAINE: You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
ELAINE: you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
ELAINE: You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
ELAINE: You know I really hate my clothes.
ELAINE: You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
ELAINE: You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food.
ELAINE: You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
ELAINE: You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
ELAINE: You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?

ELAINE: You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
ELAINE: You know that guy downstairs?
ELAINE: You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual.
ELAINE: You know that store, Putumayo? I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
ELAINE: You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
ELAINE: You know the Three Tenors?
ELAINE: You know we were here, ahead of you.
ELAINE: You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
ELAINE: You know what he does in there? He gargles.
ELAINE: You know what I bet it is? Your remote.
ELAINE: You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
ELAINE: You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
ELAINE: You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
ELAINE: You know what, I'm leavin'.
ELAINE: you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
ELAINE: You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
ELAINE: You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
ELAINE: You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
ELAINE: You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
ELAINE: You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. I'm gonna check my messages.
ELAINE: You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
ELAINE: You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
ELAINE: You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
ELAINE: You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
ELAINE: You know why? One word: shade.
ELAINE: You know you're chippin' in.
ELAINE: You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
ELAINE: You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
ELAINE: You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
ELAINE: You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
ELAINE: You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
ELAINE: You know, George, that's an onion.
ELAINE: You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
ELAINE: You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
ELAINE: You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
ELAINE: You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
ELAINE: You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
ELAINE: You know, I'm going as a beard.
ELAINE: You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual.
ELAINE: You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
ELAINE: You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
ELAINE: You know, it's not really that terrible.
ELAINE: You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
ELAINE: You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
ELAINE: You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
ELAINE: You know, Kenny Rogers has a-
ELAINE: You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
ELAINE: You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
ELAINE: You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
ELAINE: You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
ELAINE: You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
ELAINE: You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
ELAINE: You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
ELAINE: You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
ELAINE: You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
ELAINE: You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
ELAINE: You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
ELAINE: You know, that button looks very familiar.
ELAINE: You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
ELAINE: You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
ELAINE: You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
ELAINE: You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said Costanza?
ELAINE: You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
ELAINE: You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
ELAINE: You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
ELAINE: You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
ELAINE: You know, uh...they're fake.
ELAINE: You know, we had a really bad break-up.
ELAINE: You know, we should say something.
ELAINE: You know, Witchy Woman. 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
ELAINE: You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
ELAINE: You know... the spirit world.
ELAINE: You know...*the* move.
ELAINE: You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
ELAINE: You left your door open.
ELAINE: You lie.
ELAINE: You look ridiculous in that thing.
ELAINE: You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
ELAINE: You mean in a real Fight Fight?
ELAINE: You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
ELAINE: You mean like like?
ELAINE: You mean lying to your uncle?
ELAINE: You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
ELAINE: You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
ELAINE: You mean...?
ELAINE: You mean..?
ELAINE: You mean..?!
ELAINE: You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
ELAINE: You missed quite a performance.
ELAINE: You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
ELAINE: You never get good haircuts.

ELAINE: You really oughtta do something about that cold.
ELAINE: You really think he wants the bike?
ELAINE: You remember Katy?
ELAINE: You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
ELAINE: You remember the date?
ELAINE: You said it was an emergency.
ELAINE: You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
ELAINE: You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. Bouys!
ELAINE: You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
ELAINE: You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
ELAINE: You see? Again.
ELAINE: You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
ELAINE: You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
ELAINE: You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
ELAINE: You should run for mayor.

ELAINE: Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
ELAINE: Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
ELAINE: Cause then I could move in here.
ELAINE: Scuse me, master packer...
ELAINE: Coccoon II: The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.

ELAINELAINE: I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!
ELANE: I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.
ELDRIDGE: Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you.
ELDRIDGE: Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was.. It was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw.
ELDRIDGE: The boat sank.
ELDRIDGE: We had to abandon ship.
ELDRIDGE: Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.
ELECTRICIAN: Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry.
ELECTRICIAN: Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.

ELLEN: Oh, Jerry, you're parking meter's about to expire. Don't get up, I've got change.
ELLEN: So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time you have left to live.
ELLEN: Today's my birthday.
ELLEN: Yeah, I remember you.
ELLEN: Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club. You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?
ELLEN: Yeah, no one called.
ELLEN: Yeah.
EMILY: Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you left.
EMILY: C'mon, it was probably the wind.
EMILY: Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's tomorrow night.
EMILY: Eight thirty.
EMILY: Goodnight.
EMILY: I don't know.

ENZO: It's your uncle Enzo.
ENZO: Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhand. How can you have hand like a scissor, huh? Show me one person who's got hand like a scissor.
ENZO: Oh Jerry.

ESTELLE: All right...
ESTELLE: Alright Frank that's enough.
ESTELLE: Alright, let's go.
ESTELLE: And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
ESTELLE: Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
ESTELLE: Are you sure you're talking about George?
ESTELLE: Are you trying to get rid of us?
ESTELLE: Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.
ESTELLE: Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
ESTELLE: Big? No, just my height.
ESTELLE: Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
ESTELLE: Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
ESTELLE: Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
ESTELLE: But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?

ESTELLE: Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
ESTELLE: Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
ESTELLE: Did he say Assman?
ESTELLE: Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
ESTELLE: Dinner's ready!
ESTELLE: Don't give me Ma. It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
ESTELLE: Don't upset me! I can't cry!
ESTELLE: Don't you talk about Hennie!
ESTELLE: Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.
ESTELLE: Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
ESTELLE: Frank, I'm cold!
ESTELLE: Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
ESTELLE: Fusilli?
ESTELLE: George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
ESTELLE: George likes the bananas!
ESTELLE: George what are you doing in there?
ESTELLE: George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
ESTELLE: George, where are you going?!
ESTELLE: George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
ESTELLE: George, your mother and I, and Kramer have been talking.
ESTELLE: George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
ESTELLE: George?
ESTELLE: Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
ESTELLE: Georgie's right.
ESTELLE: Georgie, can you zip me up?
ESTELLE: Georgie, I'm a divorcee.
ESTELLE: Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.
ESTELLE: Georgie.
ESTELLE: Georgie.
ESTELLE: Georgie. Come here and say hello.
ESTELLE: Georgie.. Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
ESTELLE: Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
ESTELLE: Get the hell outta here. I'm sorry you came.
ESTELLE: Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
ESTELLE: Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
ESTELLE: Good for you, Lloyd!
ESTELLE: He doesn't know anything about bras.
ESTELLE: He looks ridiculous in that thing...
ESTELLE: He told you he liked it?
ESTELLE: He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
ESTELLE: Hello
ESTELLE: Hello Jerry.
ESTELLE: Hello Seinfelds.
ESTELLE: Hello, hello!
ESTELLE: Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
ESTELLE: Hello?
ESTELLE: Here's your omelet.
ESTELLE: Here, here's the bra.
ESTELLE: Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
ESTELLE: Hope you're hungry.
ESTELLE: How could they have plans?
ESTELLE: How many times can you check the car?
ESTELLE: How much is there?!
ESTELLE: I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
ESTELLE: I am not giving him a bra.
ESTELLE: I am, too!
ESTELLE: I can't believe you're moving out. Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
ESTELLE: I can't sleep in there!
ESTELLE: I can't tonight, I'm busy.
ESTELLE: I can't! I can't!
ESTELLE: I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
ESTELLE: I did not smother him.
ESTELLE: I don't bet.
ESTELLE: I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
ESTELLE: I don't like that tie.
ESTELLE: I don't swim.
ESTELLE: I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
ESTELLE: I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
ESTELLE: I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
ESTELLE: I feel a draft. Let's change tables.
ESTELLE: I hate that old door. Throw it out!
ESTELLE: I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
ESTELLE: I heard noise.
ESTELLE: I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
ESTELLE: I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
ESTELLE: I know, we were looking at the brochure.
ESTELLE: I like tap dancing.
ESTELLE: I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
ESTELLE: I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
ESTELLE: I pulled it. It doesn't go.
ESTELLE: I said milky white!
ESTELLE: I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
ESTELLE: I think you can take him, Georgie!
ESTELLE: I think you're all a little touched in the head. You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
ESTELLE: I thought you were Chinese!!
ESTELLE: I told you not to give it to him!
ESTELLE: I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
ESTELLE: I told you to fix that thing.
ESTELLE: I told you. Here, think you know everything?
ESTELLE: I want to know what youre doing in there.
ESTELLE: I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
ESTELLE: I want you to go see somebody.
ESTELLE: I'll try to be more careful.
ESTELLE: I'm going upstairs.
ESTELLE: I'm having dinner with someone.
ESTELLE: I'm not betting!
ESTELLE: I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
ESTELLE: I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!!
ESTELLE: I'm sorry.
ESTELLE: Is it safe to come in?
ESTELLE: It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
ESTELLE: It was that Chinese woman.
ESTELLE: It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
ESTELLE: It's junk.
ESTELLE: It's mine. I'm his mother.
ESTELLE: It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
ESTELLE: It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
ESTELLE: It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
ESTELLE: Jerry, did you hear this?
ESTELLE: Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
ESTELLE: Kramer, I love that shirt.
ESTELLE: Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
ESTELLE: Leave him alone!
ESTELLE: Let me put your father on the phone.
ESTELLE: Lloyd?
ESTELLE: Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
ESTELLE: Maybe they don't like us.
ESTELLE: Maybe you should take a civil service test.
ESTELLE: Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
ESTELLE: Me, either.
ESTELLE: Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
ESTELLE: More stuff?!
ESTELLE: Move your crap, I'm comin' in!
ESTELLE: My coffee table!
ESTELLE: Nah, not interested.
ESTELLE: No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
ESTELLE: Nooh!
ESTELLE: Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
ESTELLE: Oh my God! This was in our bed.
ESTELLE: Oh my goodness.
ESTELLE: Oh!
ESTELLE: Oh!
ESTELLE: Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
ESTELLE: Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?
ESTELLE: Oh, hello Elaine!
ESTELLE: Oh, I can't help it!
ESTELLE: Oh, I don't care.
ESTELLE: Oh, I was so worried.
ESTELLE: Oh, it was good seeing you.
ESTELLE: Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
ESTELLE: Oh, my God!
ESTELLE: Oh, my god!
ESTELLE: Oh, my god!
ESTELLE: Oh, okay.
ESTELLE: Oh, really?
ESTELLE: Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
ESTELLE: Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
ESTELLE: Oh, the house looks very nice.
ESTELLE: Ohh.. thank you, Maestro.
ESTELLE: Ohhh.
ESTELLE: Ow! What's the matter with you?
ESTELLE: People take buses to get that rye.
ESTELLE: Phil Casacof?
ESTELLE: Physically?
ESTELLE: Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
ESTELLE: Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
ESTELLE: She was a lovely woman.
ESTELLE: She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.
ESTELLE: She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
ESTELLE: Sid Farkus.
ESTELLE: Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
ESTELLE: So George, why are you here?
ESTELLE: So what are you gonna do?!
ESTELLE: So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
ESTELLE: So what?
ESTELLE: So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
ESTELLE: So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
ESTELLE: So, how are ya, Jerry?
ESTELLE: So, I'm getting an eye job.
ESTELLE: So, is your father excited about coming home?
ESTELLE: So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.
ESTELLE: So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
ESTELLE: Somebody's at the door.
ESTELLE: Sorry to bother you, Judge.
ESTELLE: Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
ESTELLE: Stop squirming.
ESTELLE: Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
ESTELLE: Tell it to the audience. Here, I made some bologna sandwiches.
ESTELLE: That's as far as it goes.
ESTELLE: That's the way I always make it.
ESTELLE: The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
ESTELLE: The first game?!
ESTELLE: The hell with them.
ESTELLE: The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
ESTELLE: The NBC guy liked it?
ESTELLE: The proctologist? Are you okay?
ESTELLE: They picked up the show?
ESTELLE: This is the best thing we ever did.
ESTELLE: This is the only time the doctor *has*.
ESTELLE: Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
ESTELLE: Uh, Bakersoll.
ESTELLE: Uh... the phone broke.
ESTELLE: We forgot to bring it in.
ESTELLE: We were just being nice.
ESTELLE: We're moving to Florida.
ESTELLE: We're not getting divorced.
ESTELLE: Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
ESTELLE: Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
ESTELLE: Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
ESTELLE: Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
ESTELLE: Well, come on!
ESTELLE: Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
ESTELLE: Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
ESTELLE: Well, I'm out there, George.
ESTELLE: Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
ESTELLE: Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
ESTELLE: Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.
ESTELLE: Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
ESTELLE: Well, what are you doing?
ESTELLE: Well, you've seen pictures.
ESTELLE: Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
ESTELLE: Well... then... that changes everything!
ESTELLE: What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
ESTELLE: What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
ESTELLE: What are you doing here?
ESTELLE: What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.
ESTELLE: What did we ever do to them? I want to know what we did them!
ESTELLE: What did you say?
ESTELLE: What does he want with your swim trunks?
ESTELLE: What extremities?
ESTELLE: What is this doing on my bed?!
ESTELLE: What's going on in here? Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
ESTELLE: What's the matter with your arm?
ESTELLE: What's this.
ESTELLE: Where am I going to sleep?
ESTELLE: Where do you get your genes from?!
ESTELLE: Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
ESTELLE: Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
ESTELLE: Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
ESTELLE: Why can't we sit over there?
ESTELLE: Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
ESTELLE: Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
ESTELLE: Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
ESTELLE: Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
ESTELLE: With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...
ESTELLE: Wow!
ESTELLE: Yeah, what is it?
ESTELLE: Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
ESTELLE: Yes. Who are you...?
ESTELLE: You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
ESTELLE: You dont feel well?
ESTELLE: You got ketchup on it!
ESTELLE: You know
ESTELLE: You know how to write?
ESTELLE: You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
ESTELLE: You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. Ah there's Kramer.
ESTELLE: You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
ESTELLE: You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
ESTELLE: You think they're coming tonight?
ESTELLE: You're back.
ESTELLE: You're driving me crazy!
ESTELLE: You're late!
ESTELLE: You're not Chinese!
ESTELLE: You're not Chinese!?!?
ESTELLE: You're not giving away our Waterpik!
ESTELLE: You're not gonna give away that water pik!
ESTELLE: You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
ESTELLE: You've been cooped up in this room too long.
ESTELLE: Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
ESTELLE: Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
ESTELLE: Your father's right. It's beautiful.
ETHAN: ....Champagne Coolies, please.
ETHAN: ..And pay plenty for them.
ETHAN: Behold .. The Technicolor Dreamcoat.
ETHAN: Have you ever thought about selling it .It would make a brilliant wig..
ETHAN: Hi George.. How was your day?
ETHAN: How can she go with a guy like that, he's a mess... I just don't see them together at all
ETHAN: How you doin'?
ETHAN: I already ask him that. He said Good...Good day....
ETHAN: I am getting so much work done..... See?
ETHAN: I'm Ethan
ETHAN: I'm touring with Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat
ETHAN: Right George! I get the feeling he doesn't want me there.
ETHAN: There's your Champagne Coolie. Well looks like it's just you and me cowboy!.
ETHAN: This is Jerry.
ETHAN: Well that's the grand tour ... Aw but I save the best for last...
ETHAN: Yes..
ETHAN: You've got really beautiful hair.
ETHAN: Right, Right.
EULOGIST: Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world  a simpler world  with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony. Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. Its lustrous coat, its flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow.
EVA: But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.
EVA: Get out!!
EVA: It's for me. Hello? It's O'Brien.
EVA: Never.
EVA: No.
EVA: Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter.
EVA: There was no picture on the book jacket.
EVA: We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.
EVA: Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.
EVA: What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?
EVA: Who are you?
EVA: Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.
EVA: Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?
EVELYN: Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.
EVELYN: Blanche told me.
EVELYN: Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.
EVELYN: Good morning.
EVELYN: Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
EVELYN: He's voting to impeach.
EVELYN: Hello Jerry.
EVELYN: Hello, Jerry. I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus.
EVELYN: Hello?
EVELYN: I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.
EVELYN: Is everybody up?
EVELYN: Jerry you got thin.
EVELYN: Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.
EVELYN: Mrs Choate.
EVELYN: Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.
EVELYN: Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided.
EVELYN: Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.
EVELYN: Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car.
EVELYN: Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.
EVELYN: So where's the new pen?
EVELYN: That's some good pen. It writes upside down.
EVELYN: The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.
EVELYN: What are you talking about?
EVELYN: Who?
EVELYN: Why you don't like the pen?
EVELYN: Yes, they're having a party.
EVERYBODY: Yeah! Yeah!
EVERYONE: Heyyyyyyyy.
EVERYONE: Hi.
EX: Whatever.EXECUTIVE 1: I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan.
EXECUTIVE 1: Is this customary in your legal system?
EXECUTIVE 1: SUBTITLE: Again with the oranges
EXECUTIVE 1: SUBTITLE: Are you following any of this?
EXECUTIVE 1: SUBTITLE: We suspect his friend here is also unbalanced.
EXECUTIVE 1: SUBTITLE: With these two idiots I don't know how the Yankees won the World Series.
EXECUTIVE 1: We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?
EXECUTIVE 1: Yes. Cleaned up the coffee stain, left by Jerry Seinfield.
EXECUTIVE 1: You must go now.
EXECUTIVE 2: SUBTITLE: I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.
FAN: Hey, body-suit man.
FAN: Hey, body-suit man. 's up?
FARKUS: ...But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner.
FARKUS: : Get out! I'm terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont...
FARKUS: And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I know, when I'm wearing Banlon, there appears to be some jiggling.
FARKUS: Excellent.
FARKUS: Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating.
FARKUS: Have you ever sold a woman's line before?
FARKUS: Hum. tell me about it.
FARKUS: I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh, I hope you don't think uh, this is out of line, but would it be okay with you, if I were to ask her out?
FARKUS: No, Frank...
FARKUS: Oh, no, Frank, I was just saying...
FARKUS: See you monday 9 o'clock.
FARKUS: So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What?
FARKUS: So, basically George the job here is quite simple. Selling bras.
FARKUS: Summer nights.
FARKUS: That's an incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres.
FARKUS: Uh, this is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. He's supposed to start on monday.
FARKUS: Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea.
FARKUS: Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont...
FARKUS: Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you will have a very bright future here at E.D. Granmont.
FARKUS: Yes, Ms. De Granmont?
FARKUS: You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilising fifty percent of the market.
FARMER: Ahh, Susie here'll teach you.
FARMER: Calm down, now. Calm down. Don't worry, we'll take care of you. This farm ain't much, but uh, you're welcome to what we have. Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed.
FARMER: Enjoy that mutton?
FARMER: Gonna be milking Holsteins in the morning, if you'd like to lend a hand.
FARMER: Hello stranger.
FARMER: I told you to keep away from my daughter!
FARMER: Just gotta pull on the teat a little.
FARMER: Just have one rule. Keep your hands off my daughter.
FARMER: That cider too strong for you?
FATHER CURTIS: Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.
FATHER CURTIS: Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng to the devil by the coffee machine?
FATHER CURTIS: Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell.
FATHER CURTIS: Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have difficulty--
FATHER CURTIS: You aren't?
FATHER HERNANDEZ: Aha, bueno.
FATHER HERNANDEZ: Bueno.
FATHER HERNANDEZ: El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!!
FATHER HERNANDEZ: Huh?
FATHER HERNANDEZ: Oh. La Madonna! Madre de Christo! Yo estoy lista!
FATHER JESSUP: I'm about to get myself a snack.
FATHER JESSUP: This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.
FATHER JESSUP: You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative.
FATHER: And this offends you as a Jewish person.
FATHER: I have a discomfort in my molar.
FATHER: I haven't heard that one.
FATHER: I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other weekend.
FATHER: Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife.
FATHER: Naw, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob kills someone they through the body in the river.
FATHER: Now if you'll excuse me.
FATHER: Now Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much, but sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
FATHER: One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed.
FATHER: Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives.
FATHER: Tell me your sins, my son.
FATHER: That's a kneeler.
FATHER: That's no sin.
FATHER: Um...
FATHER: We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony.
FATHER: Well.
FDR: All right.
FDR: Alright.
FDR: Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead!
FDR: I have my reasons.
FDR: I like it a lot. Ow!
FDR: I-I-I stuck a rock in there too.
FDR: Oh!
FDR: That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star and double-wished you, to drop dead. Here's your change.
FDR: That's just a silly superstition.
FDR: That's right. My birthday wish was that you drop dead.
FDR: Then I'm quadruple-wishing!
FDR: These thingsll kill ya... but so what...Youre already gonna drop dead
FELDMAN: Feldman.. From across the hall.
FELDMAN: Feldman.. From across the hall.
FELDMAN: He-ey, Kevin!
FELDMAN: Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?
FELDMAN: Hey, what are friends for?
FELDMAN: I got 'em..
FELDMAN: Kevin! Brought some groceries.
FELDMAN: Look who I ran into.
FELDMAN: Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.
FEMALE CUSTOMER: Hey, what's going on in there?
FEMALE CUSTOMER: This woman has been in there for over an hour.
FEMALE WORKER: Elaine, cake?
FEMALE WORKER: It's carrot. It's good for you.
FEMALE WORKER: It's Walter's special day.
FIREMAN: All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it!
FIREMAN: How do you live with yourself?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Mr. Seinfeld?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance.
FLORIST: Cop made me disconnect it.
FLORIST: How would you happen to know that?
FLORIST: You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?
FOOTNOTES: Really short bios:
FOREMAN: We find the defendants - guilty.
FOREMAN: We have, Your Honor.
FOWLER: Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.
FOWLER: No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!
FOWLER: Where are the cameras?
FRANK AND ESTELLE: All right! All right!
FRANK COSTANZA: How could you have traded Buhner for Ken Phelps?
FRANK: ...I got one at home.
FRANK: ...You can have the hi-fi. I don't need it now...
FRANK: 2 o'clock.
FRANK: A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
FRANK: A woman? What are you out of your mind?
FRANK: Aah!!!
FRANK: Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
FRANK: Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
FRANK: Also internal problems.
FRANK: And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
FRANK: And I can breathe easier, too.
FRANK: And it was safe.
FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
FRANK: And she's not welcome in this house!
FRANK: And stay away from those squirrels.
FRANK: And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
FRANK: Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
FRANK: Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
FRANK: Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
FRANK: Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
FRANK: Assman? I'll get him, Assman!
FRANK: Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
FRANK: Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
FRANK: Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
FRANK: Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
FRANK: Blow out the candles!!
FRANK: But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
FRANK: But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
FRANK: But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!
FRANK: C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.
FRANK: Can I talk to her, please?
FRANK: Carlo! It's me, Frank! I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
FRANK: Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
FRANK: Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?
FRANK: Costanza, you're white hot!
FRANK: Definitely velcro.
FRANK: Didn't I give you my old record player?
FRANK: Do you think you can handle it?
FRANK: Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
FRANK: Don't bring me down. Do you have another copy of that photo?
FRANK: Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
FRANK: Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice.
FRANK: Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
FRANK: Eight ball.
FRANK: Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
FRANK: Elaine took it?
FRANK: Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.
FRANK: Estelle's got the jimmy arms.
FRANK: Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
FRANK: Except, we gotta do something about the name.
FRANK: First Kramer, then Elaine?
FRANK: Five dollars a game, huh?
FRANK: Follow through? What do you mean?
FRANK: Gamebird?
FRANK: George! George!
FRANK: George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
FRANK: George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
FRANK: George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me . This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
FRANK: George, open the door.
FRANK: George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.
FRANK: George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes.
FRANK: George? This is a surprise. Who's the suit?
FRANK: Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?
FRANK: Get outta here! We have a booth.
FRANK: Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
FRANK: Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
FRANK: Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.
FRANK: Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
FRANK: Good. He left the door unlocked.
FRANK: Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
FRANK: Have you seen the pole, Kruger?
FRANK: he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
FRANK: He said I was dead?
FRANK: He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
FRANK: He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
FRANK: He was my lawyer.
FRANK: He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
FRANK: He's gonna see it.
FRANK: He's not family. It's different, psychologically.
FRANK: He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
FRANK: Hello, woman.
FRANK: Here, Cosmo...
FRANK: Here, take a look at this.
FRANK: Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?
FRANK: Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
FRANK: Hey! Lloyd!
FRANK: Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!
FRANK: Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same: you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
FRANK: Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
FRANK: Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?
FRANK: His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
FRANK: Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
FRANK: How 'bout uh... the mansiere?
FRANK: How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.
FRANK: How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. AH! A mouse! I saw a mouse!
FRANK: How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
FRANK: How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
FRANK: How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
FRANK: How did you know?
FRANK: How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
FRANK: How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
FRANK: How hard could it be to kill this thing?
FRANK: How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
FRANK: How'd you get yours?
FRANK: Huh?
FRANK: I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
FRANK: I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.
FRANK: I can't make anything..
FRANK: I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
FRANK: I didn't read his resume.
FRANK: I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that!
FRANK: I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
FRANK: I don't know what you mean.
FRANK: I don't like this waiter. Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
FRANK: I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. Hello, Sam. How are you doing, Joe? Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
FRANK: I feel ten years younger.
FRANK: I fell on some Fusilli.
FRANK: I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
FRANK: I got things to do, too.
FRANK: I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
FRANK: I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun!
FRANK: I had an affair with a Korean woman.
FRANK: I had to make a living!
FRANK: I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
FRANK: I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
FRANK: I knew it was Elaine!!
FRANK: I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
FRANK: I like mansiere.
FRANK: I never seen people treated like this!
FRANK: I never seen your arm move like this.
FRANK: I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
FRANK: I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
FRANK: I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
FRANK: I still say we're related.
FRANK: I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
FRANK: I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
FRANK: I will not tolerate infestation.
FRANK: I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
FRANK: I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
FRANK: I'd know him anywhere.
FRANK: I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
FRANK: I'll talk to her any way I want!
FRANK: I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.
FRANK: I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
FRANK: I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
FRANK: I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
FRANK: I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger?
FRANK: I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous.
FRANK: I'm the father.
FRANK: If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
FRANK: In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! Hmmph! I stopped short.
FRANK: In my mind, there's a war still going on.
FRANK: Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
FRANK: Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
FRANK: Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
FRANK: It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
FRANK: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. A Festivus for the rest of us!
FRANK: It's a Coupe de Elegance.
FRANK: It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
FRANK: It's a slap in the face.
FRANK: It's Carlo. I found him!
FRANK: It's creative black tie. Move, woman.
FRANK: It's cruise wear!
FRANK: It's dry.
FRANK: It's him! It's Carlo Costanza!
FRANK: It's like some kind of aaaaa spasm.
FRANK: It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
FRANK: It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
FRANK: Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
FRANK: Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
FRANK: Kasha?
FRANK: Kim?
FRANK: Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
FRANK: Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
FRANK: Lemme change my shirt.
FRANK: Let me see it.
FRANK: Let me see it.
FRANK: Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
FRANK: Let's begin.
FRANK: Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space.
FRANK: Let's do it!
FRANK: Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation.
FRANK: Let's rumble!
FRANK: Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!
FRANK: Like you wouldn't believe.
FRANK: Look at this, George. You ever seen a silver dollar?
FRANK: Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
FRANK: Manssierre!
FRANK: Manssierre! You...!
FRANK: Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
FRANK: Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say,  eno enoa juang . Which means, this guy - this is not my kind of guy.
FRANK: Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
FRANK: Maybe?
FRANK: Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.
FRANK: Moths, ate three boxes?
FRANK: My clothes don't have moths!
FRANK: My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
FRANK: My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
FRANK: No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
FRANK: No it isn't!
FRANK: No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.
FRANK: No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
FRANK: No! Follow me.
FRANK: No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
FRANK: No! You never said milky white!
FRANK: No, bro's no good. Too ethnic.
FRANK: No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
FRANK: No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.
FRANK: No, not billiard.. Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
FRANK: No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
FRANK: No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
FRANK: No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. They don't want me, I don't want them!
FRANK: Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!
FRANK: Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
FRANK: Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
FRANK: Not really.
FRANK: Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
FRANK: Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
FRANK: Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
FRANK: Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
FRANK: Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
FRANK: Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
FRANK: Oh boy.
FRANK: Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
FRANK: Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
FRANK: Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
FRANK: Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
FRANK: OK that's it! We're moving!
FRANK: Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!
FRANK: Okay, THAT'S IT! oki on awa Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.
FRANK: Okay, where's my boy?
FRANK: Okay.
FRANK: Okay...
FRANK: Or, the mansiere.
FRANK: Order a hot dish.
FRANK: Put it over there.
FRANK: Queens is full of mosquitoes.
FRANK: Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
FRANK: Read that poem.
FRANK: Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
FRANK: Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! Come here!
FRANK: Serenity now!
FRANK: Serenity now!
FRANK: Serenity nowww!
FRANK: She had problems. Internal.
FRANK: She was.
FRANK: She'd never make it.
FRANK: She's deceased.
FRANK: She's not pretty?
FRANK: Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
FRANK: So far.
FRANK: So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
FRANK: So let him have bananas on the side!
FRANK: So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
FRANK: So, we're blowing it all.
FRANK: So, what am I supposed to say?
FRANK: So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
FRANK: Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.
FRANK: Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
FRANK: Stop crying, and fight your father!
FRANK: Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother-
FRANK: Take a look.
FRANK: Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
FRANK: Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
FRANK: Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
FRANK: Thank you, Kramer.
FRANK: Thank you.
FRANK: That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?
FRANK: That's another one of my shirts!!
FRANK: THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!!
FRANK: That's it! You're grounded!
FRANK: That's it, we're going back to Queens. Where's my hat?
FRANK: That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? Gimme that back
FRANK: That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
FRANK: That's not a booth!
FRANK: That's perverse.
FRANK: That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
FRANK: That's right. That's me on the left.
FRANK: That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
FRANK: That's what we figured, huh?
FRANK: That's your mother's new car.
FRANK: The Maestro? What Maestro?
FRANK: The man on the tape wasn't specific.
FRANK: The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!
FRANK: The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
FRANK: There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
FRANK: There's a Costanza in Tuscany? Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
FRANK: There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
FRANK: They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
FRANK: They didn't say hello?
FRANK: They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
FRANK: They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
FRANK: They made a derogatory comment about me.
FRANK: They're not coming?
FRANK: Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
FRANK: This feels very comfortable.
FRANK: This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
FRANK: This is the best Festivus ever!
FRANK: This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
FRANK: This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.
FRANK: This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?
FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
FRANK: Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
FRANK: Tired.
FRANK: To a woman?
FRANK: Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
FRANK: Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
FRANK: Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
FRANK: Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
FRANK: Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
FRANK: Under arrest? What for?
FRANK: Up here?
FRANK: Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
FRANK: Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?
FRANK: We call it.. the, uh..
FRANK: We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
FRANK: We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
FRANK: We had some good times.
FRANK: We have a catered affair.
FRANK: We still haven't finished the first game.
FRANK: We'll go out for dinner tonight.
FRANK: We'll work something out.
FRANK: We're cuttin' you lose.
FRANK: We're having an upscale dinner.
FRANK: Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
FRANK: Well it sucks.
FRANK: Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
FRANK: Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
FRANK: Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
FRANK: Well, we got to get moving.
FRANK: Well... thank you very much!
FRANK: What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. She was sickly from the moment I met her!
FRANK: What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
FRANK: What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
FRANK: What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
FRANK: What d'you mean, busy?
FRANK: What do you know.. Alright. I guess I was wrong.
FRANK: What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
FRANK: What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
FRANK: What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
FRANK: What ever happened to Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?!!
FRANK: What is that, like a little chicken?
FRANK: What is this thing anyway?
FRANK: What is this? A prophylactic wrapper?!
FRANK: What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
FRANK: What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
FRANK: What stain?
FRANK: What the hell does that mean?
FRANK: What was that?
FRANK: What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
FRANK: What's that?
FRANK: What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
FRANK: What, they brainwashed you?
FRANK: What?
FRANK: Where am I supposed to sleep?
FRANK: Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
FRANK: Where the hell is my paper?
FRANK: Where's that breeze coming from?
FRANK: Where's the mail?
FRANK: Where's the powdered sugar?
FRANK: Where's your friend Kramer?
FRANK: Who is this?
FRANK: Who put you up to this, was it her?
FRANK: Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
FRANK: Who's Rudy? What clothes?
FRANK: Who's this Rudy?
FRANK: Why do you need all that ketchup for?
FRANK: Why not?
FRANK: Why should they go to waste?!?
FRANK: Why wouldn't they like us? Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
FRANK: Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
FRANK: Why'd you take my TV Guide?
FRANK: Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
FRANK: Will you put her to rest for me?
FRANK: Will you stop it?
FRANK: With whom?
FRANK: Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
FRANK: Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?
FRANK: Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
FRANK: Ya got T-Fal?
FRANK: Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
FRANK: Yeah, we worked it out.
FRANK: Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
FRANK: Yeah.
FRANK: Yeah. I'll take some.
FRANK: Yeah. So what?
FRANK: Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
FRANK: Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
FRANK: Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
FRANK: Yes?
FRANK: You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
FRANK: You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.
FRANK: You can look for sneakers the next day!
FRANK: You come here.
FRANK: You don't even know what they're made from.
FRANK: You don't know that! We're gonna go see him, huh?
FRANK: You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
FRANK: You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.
FRANK: You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
FRANK: You have no eye for fashion!!!
FRANK: You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
FRANK: You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
FRANK: You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.
FRANK: You like to gamble, Cosmo?
FRANK: You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
FRANK: You never mentioned them to me!
FRANK: You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants?
FRANK: You sayin' you want a piece of me?
FRANK: You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
FRANK: You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
FRANK: You sold my clothes what do you mean you sold my clothes?
FRANK: You step on it and it flushes.
FRANK: You still need a cook?
FRANK: You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.
FRANK: You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
FRANK: You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!
FRANK: You wanna go out with my wife?! Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
FRANK: You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. You're grounded!
FRANK: You wanna piece of me? You got it!
FRANK: You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
FRANK: You want me to wear a bra?!
FRANK: You were having sex on our bed?!
FRANK: You were the one who smothered him.
FRANK: You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.
FRANK: You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
FRANK: You're not kidding it's a good move!
FRANK: You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
FRANK: You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
FRANK: Your arm moves like this?
FRANK: Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!
FRANK: Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
FRANK: Your mother changed her mind...
FRANK: Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
FRANK: Your mother recommended him.
FRANK: Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
FRANK: Youve been in there an hour.
FRANKIE: Come on. Let's take it for a spin.
FRANKIE: I gotta go to the park.
FRANKIE: I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
FRANKIE: I'm, uh, I'm so stupid.
FRANKIE: Is this Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?!
FRANKIE: Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?
FRANKIE: It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive?
FRANKIE: Jerry!
FRANKIE: Nice captain's chairs, huh?
FRANKIE: No, that's us.
FRANKIE: Now you gotta sell this van.
FRANKIE: Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.
FRANKIE: Ohh...
FRANKIE: So, can we go for a ride?
FRANKIE: Stupid... so stupid! Jerry?
FRANKIE: The winter me.
FRANKIE: This is it.
FRANKIE: You don't like the van?
FRANKIE: You hate the van.
FRED SAVAGE: Thank you.
FRED: ...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so expensive! She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her.
FRED: Alright, let's get to it.
FRED: Anyway, go on.
FRED: Cause they make you nauseous, right?
FRED: Do you wanna have dinner tonight?
FRED: Hey Jerry.
FRED: I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.
FRED: I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it.
FRED: Mmm, no.
FRED: No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys.
FRED: Not ringing a bell.
FRED: Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out.
FRED: Oh yeah, yeah, right.
FRED: Oh, we only wake you up for the important meetings.
FRED: Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.
FRED: Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.
FRED: Reilly doesn't work here any more.
FRED: Soo - what happened?!
FRED: Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?
FRED: Thanks.
FRED: That's ok. Relax, relax.
FRED: The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.
FRED: The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's no transportation...
FRED: Um, hello?
FRED: We have?
FRED: What was your name again?
FRED: What, you have other plans?
FRED: Who's Russ Meyer?
FRED: Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted.
FRED: Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!
FRED: Yeah.
FRED: Yeah?
FRED: You're lucky, at least you got something to do.FRIEND 1: Great party, K-man!
FRIEND 1: Hey, Kramer,
FRIEND 1: It's getting late. Maybe we better get going.
FRIEND 1: Ramirez has never heard your pants story.
FRIEND: What about that underwater escape?
FULTON: Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh.
FULTON: I haven't cracked a smile in months.
FULTON: It's a fine time.
FULTON: Stop.
FULTON: Stop.
FURNITURE GUY: I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.
FURNITURE GUY: I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.
GAIL: Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.
GAIL: Didn't you love it?
GAIL: He snubbed me.
GAIL: Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?
GAIL: Hi, Elaine. Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?
GAIL: How'd everything go with that NBC guy?
GAIL: How's everything?
GAIL: I am not discussing this. This is insane.
GAIL: It's even better the second time.
GAIL: Look Elaine, I am very busy here.
GAIL: No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. Oh! See ya.
GAIL: Pfeiffer's.
GAIL: She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.
GAIL: So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?
GAIL: So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her.
GAIL: Well, tell him that I am mad at him.
GAIL: What are you talking about?
GAIL: What?
GAIL: Where'd you get 'em?
GAIL: Ya ya ya, here.
GAIL: Ya. Elaine...!
GAIL: Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?
GARDNER: He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us bastards out on the town. I said: that son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store for him!.
GARDNER: I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch in the front office. Wilhelm, I think his name.
GARY: All right, I got lunch, all right.
GARY: All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right?
GARY: All right.
GARY: Hey George.
GARY: Hey Jerry, th... George, you decided to get a rug! Good for you, Jack!
GARY: Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own that parking lot around the corner.
GARY: Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, Jack!
GARY: Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my fillings, 'cos that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings.
GARY: I know. I've been pretty busy.
GARY: I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!
GARY: Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.
GARY: Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you.
GARY: Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look.
GARY: Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi.
GARY: Oh. Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.
GARY: Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie.
GARY: Really?
GARY: Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself.
GARY: She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody. Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack!
GARY: This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight City Hall.
GARY: Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows.
GARY: Well, I I never actually had cancer. I'll see you.
GARY: Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're loaded.
GARY: What d'you think? Check it out.
GARY: Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice.
GARY: Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for you. You just have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month.
GARY: Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry.
GARY: You didn't?!
GAS STATION ATTENDANT: That's uh, $18.50.
GAURD: We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond.
GAVIN: Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!
GAVIN: Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.
GAVIN: He won't hurt you, he's just playing.
GAVIN: I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
GAVIN: Jerry?
GAVIN: Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.
GAVIN: My dog. What about my dog?
GAVIN: Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?
GAVIN: Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.
GAVIN: Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.
GAVIN: Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.
GAVIN: Would you take care of Farfel?
GAVIN: Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians.
GAVIN: You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.
GENDERSON: Ah, just drive.
GENDERSON: I told you not to take the turnpike.
GENDERSON: If we took the palisades this never have happened.
GENE: At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance.
GENE: Don't worry about it.
GENE: Haven't you done enough already?
GENE: I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.
GENE: I got it.
GENE: What is the matter with you?
GENNICE: . . . Thank you.
GENNICE: Hi Jerry.
GENNICE: How do you like this?
GENNICE: I gotta go.
GENNICE: I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy. Nobody in the show will even talk to me.
GENNICE: I'm really nervous.
GENNICE: My grandmother died.
GENNICE: Nice to meet you.
GENNICE: No it was really good.
GENNICE: No, please. This is the first time in my life that anyone has ever done anything like this for me. I've always had to struggle so hard for everything I ever got. and I know this is going to be my big break.
GENNICE: No. I'm on the bench today.
GENNICE: Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened.
GENNICE: Oh, it's okay,
GENNICE: Oh, yeah, she'll be here. . . . Oh no, my frankfurter, my frankfurter fell . It was really good. I can't believe that I dropped it.
GENNICE: What?

GEORGE AND JERRY: Ohh, no. No, no, no..
GEORGE WENDT: Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah.
GEORGE WENDT: It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar.

GEORGE: 'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
GEORGE: 'Things'll be great, when you're...'
GEORGE: 'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
GEORGE: 'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved.

GEORGE: . . . she scooped her niblets?
GEORGE: . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
GEORGE: . . . Why not?
GEORGE: . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
GEORGE: . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.

GEORGE: ...she calls me up at my office
GEORGE: ...Six wrong?
GEORGE: ...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
GEORGE: ...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer, right?

GEORGE: All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
GEORGE: All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
GEORGE: All my friends do that.

GEORGE: All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
GEORGE: All right. Let's get to work.
GEORGE: All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
GEORGE: All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
GEORGE: All right. See you tomorrow.
GEORGE: All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
GEORGE: All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
GEORGE: All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
GEORGE: All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
GEORGE: All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.

GEORGE: All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
GEORGE: All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry.
GEORGE: All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
GEORGE: All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.

Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. Cynthia, right?
GEORGE: Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
GEORGE: Alright, but I'm serious about this.
GEORGE: Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
GEORGE: Alright, bye.

GEORGE: Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
GEORGE: Alright, let's go.
GEORGE: Alright, let's go.
GEORGE: Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
GEORGE: Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
GEORGE: Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...

GEORGE: Alright, maybe I do. So what.
GEORGE: Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
GEORGE: Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
GEORGE: Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
GEORGE: Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
GEORGE: Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1, 900 dollars. 1, 900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
GEORGE: Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
GEORGE: Alright, so, go ahead.
GEORGE: Alright, so, we need something..
GEORGE: Alright, start looking for spaces.
GEORGE: Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.

GEORGE: Alright.
GEORGE: Alright.
GEORGE: Alright.
GEORGE: Alright. 7, 7, 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
GEORGE: Alright. Alright.

GEORGE: Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
GEORGE: Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
GEORGE: Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here.
GEORGE: Alright..
GEORGE: Alright?
GEORGE: Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
GEORGE: Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
GEORGE: Always late. Always late.
GEORGE: Always.
GEORGE: Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
GEORGE: An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
GEORGE: An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
GEORGE: An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
GEORGE: An idea for the show.
GEORGE: An idea.
GEORGE: An ostrich burger.
GEORGE: An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
GEORGE: and
GEORGE: and
GEORGE: and
GEORGE: and
GEORGE: And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!
GEORGE: And a slice of devil's food cake.
GEORGE: And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey.
GEORGE: And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
GEORGE: And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
GEORGE: And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
GEORGE: And God didn't kill me.
GEORGE: And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
GEORGE: And him!
GEORGE: And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
GEORGE: And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something.
GEORGE: And I am not a piece of toast.
GEORGE: And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
GEORGE: And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
GEORGE: And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I cant do that to someone.
GEORGE: And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
GEORGE: And I love you, Marisa.
GEORGE: And I still say hes naked under there!
GEORGE: And I'd like a discount.
GEORGE: And I'm a little tired.
GEORGE: And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
GEORGE: And if I don't call...
GEORGE: And in bed--
GEORGE: And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
GEORGE: And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
GEORGE: And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
GEORGE: And maybe we could go out and do something.
GEORGE: And now for the trifecta.
GEORGE: And now?
GEORGE: And now?
GEORGE: And now?
GEORGE: And on your dates.
GEORGE: And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
GEORGE: And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
GEORGE: And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
GEORGE: And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.
GEORGE: And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
GEORGE: And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. Thank you, and good night.
GEORGE: And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
GEORGE: And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
GEORGE: And the Christian rock?
GEORGE: And the underwater bubble cities?
GEORGE: And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
GEORGE: And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
GEORGE: And then I took my pants off.
GEORGE: And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
GEORGE: And then you came here.
GEORGE: And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
GEORGE: And then, there were two.
GEORGE: And there's you ticket.
GEORGE: And they say appearance is not important.
GEORGE: And this is Kramer.
GEORGE: And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
GEORGE: And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
GEORGE: And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
GEORGE: And you automatically sleep with her?
GEORGE: And you don't have to pay.
GEORGE: And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
GEORGE: And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
GEORGE: And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
GEORGE: And you threw it out the window?
GEORGE: And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
GEORGE: And you're the shark?
GEORGE: And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
GEORGE: And your wine.
GEORGE: And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
GEORGE: And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
GEORGE: And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
GEORGE: And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
GEORGE: And... and anybody can do this?
GEORGE: And?
GEORGE: Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over.
GEORGE: Another job?
GEORGE: Any money in it?
GEORGE: Any more grape juice?
GEORGE: Any questions?
GEORGE: Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
GEORGE: Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
GEORGE: Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
GEORGE: Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said no, maybe we could get together for lunch. You know what that means.
GEORGE: Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
GEORGE: Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
GEORGE: Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
GEORGE: Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. Well, I guess that's about it.
GEORGE: Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
GEORGE: Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
GEORGE: Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
GEORGE: Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
GEORGE: Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, That's gotta hurt!
GEORGE: Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
GEORGE: Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
GEORGE: Anyway.
GEORGE: Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
GEORGE: Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
GEORGE: Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
GEORGE: Apply for a job? What for?
GEORGE: April.
GEORGE: Are the courses open?
GEORGE: Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
GEORGE: Are they here?
GEORGE: Are we really doing this?
GEORGE: Are you a religious man, sir?
GEORGE: Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
GEORGE: Are you coming back down?
GEORGE: Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
GEORGE: Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
GEORGE: Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
GEORGE: Are you going to help me or not?
GEORGE: Are you gonna move the car?
GEORGE: Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
GEORGE: Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
GEORGE: Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
GEORGE: ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
GEORGE: Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
GEORGE: Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
GEORGE: Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
GEORGE: Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
GEORGE: Are you supposed to yell it?
GEORGE: Are you sure?
GEORGE: Are you sure?
GEORGE: Are you sure?
GEORGE: Are you sure?
GEORGE: Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
GEORGE: Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC.
GEORGE: Are you through?
GEORGE: Are you through?
GEORGE: Are you?
GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
GEORGE: Are.. are you okay?
GEORGE: Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
GEORGE: Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
GEORGE: Aretha!
GEORGE: Argh! Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
GEORGE: Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!

GEORGE: As a suspect in a serial killing.
GEORGE: As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
GEORGE: As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
GEORGE: As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? What?! That guys eatin it!
GEORGE: Ask about you, ask about you.
GEORGE: Ask her about Kramer.
GEORGE: Ask' em Are there any side effects?
GEORGE: Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
GEORGE: Assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm uh, working on the project.
GEORGE: At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
GEORGE: Atlantic City? Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
GEORGE: Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
GEORGE: Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
GEORGE: Aunt Baby.
GEORGE: Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
GEORGE: Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.
GEORGE: Aw c'mon.
GEORGE: Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
GEORGE: Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
GEORGE: Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
GEORGE: Aw! Funny he's a funny guy.
GEORGE: Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
GEORGE: Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
GEORGE: Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
GEORGE: Aw, Kramer, don't start...
GEORGE: Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas!
GEORGE: Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.
GEORGE: Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
GEORGE: Aw, that's a fun age.
GEORGE: Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
GEORGE: Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
GEORGE: Awright, I'll see you later.
GEORGE: Awright, I'm heading home.
GEORGE: Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
GEORGE: Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
GEORGE: Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
GEORGE: B-O-Z-O?
GEORGE: Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
GEORGE: Babs left?
GEORGE: Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
GEORGE: Baked, uh, potato.
GEORGE: Bald? Uh?
GEORGE: Bania?
GEORGE: Bar?
GEORGE: Barry?
GEORGE: Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
GEORGE: Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
GEORGE: Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
GEORGE: Beats the hell out of coffee.
GEORGE: Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? Jerry?
GEORGE: Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
GEORGE: Beautiful!
GEORGE: Beautiful.
GEORGE: Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
GEORGE: Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
GEORGE: Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
GEORGE: Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
GEORGE: Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
GEORGE: Because he said I was going to.
GEORGE: Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
GEORGE: Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
GEORGE: Because I asked you to.
GEORGE: Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
GEORGE: Because I don't want to.
GEORGE: Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
GEORGE: Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
GEORGE: Because I like this one! C'mon, let's go. Let's go! Oh, hi..
GEORGE: Because I promised her.
GEORGE: Because I uh, I told her the truth.
GEORGE: Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
GEORGE: Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
GEORGE: Because I... I love you.
GEORGE: BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!
GEORGE: Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
GEORGE: Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
GEORGE: Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
GEORGE: Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
GEORGE: Because it's on TV.
GEORGE: Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
GEORGE: Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
GEORGE: Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
GEORGE: Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
GEORGE: Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
GEORGE: Because of society, right?
GEORGE: Because of the day before. It's a long story.
GEORGE: Because she asked me to.
GEORGE: Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..

GEORGE: Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
GEORGE: Elaine!
GEORGE: Elaine! ELAINE!!

GEORGE: Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? Please, make the call.
GEORGE: Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
GEORGE: Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
GEORGE: Elaine, get off the speaker!
GEORGE: Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
GEORGE: Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
GEORGE: Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, Pardon my French.
GEORGE: Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
GEORGE: Elaine, it's me, George.
GEORGE: Elaine, Julie.
GEORGE: Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
GEORGE: Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
GEORGE: Elaine, shut-up.
GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?
GEORGE: Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
GEORGE: Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
GEORGE: Elaine.
GEORGE: Elaine.
GEORGE: Elaine.
GEORGE: Elaine.
GEORGE: Elaine. Shut up.
GEORGE: Elaine.. I have to tell you something...
GEORGE: Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
GEORGE: Elaine?
GEORGE: Elaine?
GEORGE: Elaine? Can I come?
GEORGE: Elaine? Elaine! Elaine!
GEORGE: Elaine? It's me, George. Hey, sorry to bother you so late. Hey! How ya doin.' Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
GEORGE: Elaines moving into your building?
GEORGE: Elle McPherson going to be there?
GEORGE: Embezzlement.
GEORGE: Embracing my roots.
GEORGE: English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
GEORGE: Enjoy, enjoy.
GEORGE: Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
GEORGE: Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
GEORGE: Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
GEORGE: Every five years!
GEORGE: Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. I was going nuts.
GEORGE: Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
GEORGE: Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
GEORGE: Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
GEORGE: Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
GEORGE: Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.
GEORGE: Everything goes with naked.
GEORGE: Everything?
GEORGE: Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
GEORGE: Exactly!
GEORGE: Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
GEORGE: Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
GEORGE: Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
GEORGE: Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
GEORGE: Exactly.
GEORGE: Exactly.
GEORGE: Exactly.
GEORGE: Exactly. Erica!
GEORGE: Exactly..

GEORGE: Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
GEORGE: Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
GEORGE: Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
GEORGE: Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
GEORGE: Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?
GEORGE: Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
GEORGE: Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
GEORGE: Excuse me?
GEORGE: Excuse me?
GEORGE: Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
GEORGE: Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
GEORGE: Face up on her back?
GEORGE: Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
GEORGE: Fantastic day! Fantastic!
GEORGE: Fantastic!
GEORGE: Fantastic?
GEORGE: FDR?
GEORGE: Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
GEORGE: Feel? What's that?
GEORGE: Feels right.

GEORGE: Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
GEORGE: Fine. Ow!
GEORGE: Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.

GEORGE: Finished.
GEORGE: Fire! Get out of the way!
GEORGE: Fire!!
GEORGE: Fired? Why?
GEORGE: First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
GEORGE: First she screams, George, what are you doing?! My God! And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
GEORGE: Fish. What do they do?
GEORGE: Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?

GEORGE: Flip it.
GEORGE: Flowing?
GEORGE: Flying him in? How longs he staying for?

GEORGE: For how long?
GEORGE: For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?
GEORGE: For my hamstring.
GEORGE: For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
GEORGE: For vomiting on her vest!

GEORGE: Gotta get the good ones.

GEORGE: Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
GEORGE: Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.

GEORGE: Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
GEORGE: Guess, what I got.
GEORGE: GUILTY!
GEORGE: Guys with cats... I dont know.
GEORGE: Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. It's not complicated.
GEORGE: Gwen really wants to go.
GEORGE: Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.

GEORGE: Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
GEORGE: Ha, uh,
GEORGE: Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?

GEORGE: He didn't get better, did he?
GEORGE: He didn't say anything.
GEORGE: He didn't say he can't.
GEORGE: He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?

GEORGE: He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?
GEORGE: He massacred you.
GEORGE: He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
GEORGE: He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
GEORGE: He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
GEORGE: He picked her up?
GEORGE: He poked me!
GEORGE: He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
GEORGE: He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, Costanza He'd say, Can't stand ja. Can't stand ja ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
GEORGE: He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
GEORGE: He said he didn't know what it was.

GEORGE: I am aware. I am aware.
GEORGE: I am different, yeah.
GEORGE: I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
GEORGE: I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
GEORGE: I am king of the county. You?
GEORGE: I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
GEORGE: I am not buying something just to get change.
GEORGE: I am not giving you my code.
GEORGE: I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
GEORGE: I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
GEORGE: I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
GEORGE: I am ready.
GEORGE: I am staying out all night!
GEORGE: I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
GEORGE: I am.
GEORGE: I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
GEORGE: I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. I'm basking in the buffer zone. 'Nother piece of pie here!
GEORGE: I am?
GEORGE: I am? What a strange coincidence..
GEORGE: I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
GEORGE: I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An aaaa . . .
GEORGE: I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
GEORGE: I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
GEORGE: I believe strongly in that as you know.
GEORGE: I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
GEORGE: I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
GEORGE: I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
GEORGE: I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
GEORGE: I bet they have more money than mine.
GEORGE: I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday?
GEORGE: I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
GEORGE: I bought it.
GEORGE: I broke 'em playing basketball.
GEORGE: I broke up with her.
GEORGE: I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
GEORGE: I called it.
GEORGE: I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
GEORGE: I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
GEORGE: I can do this, Jerry.
GEORGE: I can never get the package open in time.
GEORGE: I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
GEORGE: I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
GEORGE: I can see that.
GEORGE: I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
GEORGE: I can't
GEORGE: I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
GEORGE: I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
GEORGE: I can't believe I get paid for this.
GEORGE: I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
GEORGE: I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
GEORGE: I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
GEORGE: I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
GEORGE: I can't believe that you saw her before me.
GEORGE: I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
GEORGE: I can't believe this is happening.
GEORGE: I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
GEORGE: I can't believe this.
GEORGE: I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
GEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
GEORGE: I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
GEORGE: I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
GEORGE: I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
GEORGE: I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
GEORGE: I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
GEORGE: I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
GEORGE: I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
GEORGE: I can't do these puzzles.
GEORGE: I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
GEORGE: I can't drive?
GEORGE: I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?
GEORGE: I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
GEORGE: I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
GEORGE: I can't get a massage from a man.
GEORGE: I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
GEORGE: I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
GEORGE: I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
GEORGE: I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
GEORGE: I can't go.
GEORGE: I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
GEORGE: I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
GEORGE: I can't have any parties while they're out of town.
GEORGE: I can't hear you.
GEORGE: I can't imagine.
GEORGE: I can't just leave.
GEORGE: I can't park in a garage.
GEORGE: I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
GEORGE: I can't read it. I need my glasses!
GEORGE: I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
GEORGE: I can't say.
GEORGE: I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?!
GEORGE: I can't tell anymore.
GEORGE: I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
GEORGE: I can't tell ya now, he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
GEORGE: I can't tell you, don't ask.
GEORGE: I can't tell you.
GEORGE: I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
GEORGE: I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!
GEORGE: I can't.
GEORGE: I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
GEORGE: I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
GEORGE: I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
GEORGE: I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
GEORGE: I cant believe I won at Inka-dink.
GEORGE: I cant believe what Im hearing.
GEORGE: I cant believe- WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
GEORGE: I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
GEORGE: I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
GEORGE: I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
GEORGE: I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
GEORGE: I cheated in the contest.
GEORGE: I climbed out the window.
GEORGE: I confused it with another awning.
GEORGE: I could be a character.
GEORGE: I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
GEORGE: I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
GEORGE: I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
GEORGE: I could see that...
GEORGE: I could take it in merchandise..
GEORGE: I could..
GEORGE: I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
GEORGE: I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
GEORGE: I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
GEORGE: I couldn't take it anymore.
GEORGE: I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
GEORGE: I did it! It's all done!
GEORGE: I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
GEORGE: I did!
GEORGE: I did, I'm trying to call China.
GEORGE: I did.
GEORGE: I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
GEORGE: I did?
GEORGE: I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
GEORGE: I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
GEORGE: I didn't do nothin'.
GEORGE: I didn't encourage. No encourage.
GEORGE: I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
GEORGE: I didn't even know it was a job.
GEORGE: I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
GEORGE: I didn't get any bread.
GEORGE: I didn't get any bread.
GEORGE: I didn't get the job?
GEORGE: I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
GEORGE: I didn't have any sex.
GEORGE: I didn't have make-up sex.
GEORGE: I didn't know he'd get fired.
GEORGE: I didn't know she took it!
GEORGE: I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
GEORGE: I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
GEORGE: I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
GEORGE: I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild.
GEORGE: I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
GEORGE: I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
GEORGE: I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
GEORGE: I didn't take it, yet.
GEORGE: I didn't tattle
GEORGE: I didn't think you wore them anymore.
GEORGE: I didn't.
GEORGE: I didnt know there was a fireplace.
GEORGE: I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
GEORGE: I didnt say any other bawdy things.
GEORGE: I didnt think ahead.
GEORGE: I do for the bad things.
GEORGE: I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
GEORGE: I do.
GEORGE: I don't a..
GEORGE: I don't believe it, she did it again!
GEORGE: I don't believe it, what did you say?
GEORGE: I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. My whole life is a lie.
GEORGE: I don't chew gum.
GEORGE: I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
GEORGE: I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
GEORGE: I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
GEORGE: I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
GEORGE: I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
GEORGE: I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
GEORGE: I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
GEORGE: I don't find her attractive.
GEORGE: I don't have a flush.
GEORGE: I don't have a hi-fi.
GEORGE: I don't have a job!
GEORGE: I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
GEORGE: I don't have my ATM card.
GEORGE: I don't know her.
GEORGE: I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
GEORGE: I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
GEORGE: I don't know if you're ready for it.
GEORGE: I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
GEORGE: I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
GEORGE: I don't know what the reason could be.
GEORGE: I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
GEORGE: I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
GEORGE: I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
GEORGE: I don't know why I'm doing this.
GEORGE: I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
GEORGE: I don't know, about three days.
GEORGE: I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
GEORGE: I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
GEORGE: I don't know, I didn't ask.
GEORGE: I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
GEORGE: I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
GEORGE: I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
GEORGE: I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
GEORGE: I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
GEORGE: I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
GEORGE: I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
GEORGE: I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
GEORGE: I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
GEORGE: I don't know, uh...
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
GEORGE: I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
GEORGE: I don't know. He said he wants to be my key brother.
GEORGE: I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
GEORGE: I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
GEORGE: I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
GEORGE: I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
GEORGE: I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
GEORGE: I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
GEORGE: I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
GEORGE: I don't know. That's all gonna change.
GEORGE: I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
GEORGE: I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
GEORGE: I don't know. Where's Kramer?
GEORGE: I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
GEORGE: I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor.
GEORGE: I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
GEORGE: I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
GEORGE: I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
GEORGE: I don't see any way around it.
GEORGE: I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
GEORGE: I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
GEORGE: I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
GEORGE: I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
GEORGE: I don't think it's gonna work out...
GEORGE: I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
GEORGE: I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
GEORGE: I don't think so.
GEORGE: I don't think we should see each other any more.
GEORGE: I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
GEORGE: I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
GEORGE: I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
GEORGE: I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
GEORGE: I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
GEORGE: I don't understand women.
GEORGE: I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
GEORGE: I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
GEORGE: I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
GEORGE: I don't want any mango.
GEORGE: I don't want him to!
GEORGE: I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
GEORGE: I don't want it to feel good.
GEORGE: I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
GEORGE: I don't want to hear it, Kramer!
GEORGE: I don't want to talk about it.
GEORGE: I don't want to walk that far.
GEORGE: I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
GEORGE: I don't want you to call.
GEORGE: I don't.
GEORGE: I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
GEORGE: I dont care.
GEORGE: I dont get art.
GEORGE: I dont know how you put up with this.
GEORGE: I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
GEORGE: I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
GEORGE: I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
GEORGE: I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs: out. Coffee: out. French fries: out. BLT: out! I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
GEORGE: I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
GEORGE: I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
GEORGE: I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
GEORGE: I dont know. But he aint funny.
GEORGE: I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
GEORGE: I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
GEORGE: I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
GEORGE: I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
GEORGE: I dont know. Theyre books.
GEORGE: I dont like to discuss figures.
GEORGE: I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. Wait a second, is that him?
GEORGE: I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
GEORGE: I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
GEORGE: I dont understand.
GEORGE: I dont want to get out of it.
GEORGE: I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
GEORGE: I dunno they said maybe.
GEORGE: I dunno, I'm in a limo. Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
GEORGE: I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
GEORGE: I dunno.
GEORGE: I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
GEORGE: I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
GEORGE: I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
GEORGE: I enjoy understanding.
GEORGE: I feel alive, Jerry.
GEORGE: I feel fat.
GEORGE: I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
GEORGE: I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
GEORGE: I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
GEORGE: I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
GEORGE: I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no
GEORGE: I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
GEORGE: I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
GEORGE: I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
GEORGE: I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
GEORGE: I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
GEORGE: I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
GEORGE: I froze. I think I'm losing it.
GEORGE: I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
GEORGE: I gave it to Cosmo.
GEORGE: I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
GEORGE: I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking: That's why I'm not heterosexual.
GEORGE: I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
GEORGE: I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
GEORGE: I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
GEORGE: I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
GEORGE: I got a headboard.
GEORGE: I got a hotel room.
GEORGE: I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
GEORGE: I got a lot of thinking to do.
GEORGE: I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
GEORGE: I got a source.
GEORGE: I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, Easy big fella! And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
GEORGE: I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
GEORGE: I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
GEORGE: I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
GEORGE: I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying I've given your gift to someone else!
GEORGE: I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
GEORGE: I got it.
GEORGE: I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back.
GEORGE: I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
GEORGE: I got lost on the way over.
GEORGE: I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
GEORGE: I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
GEORGE: I got nothing.
GEORGE: I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
GEORGE: I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
GEORGE: I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
GEORGE: I got the job?
GEORGE: I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
GEORGE: I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
GEORGE: I got to go after her.
GEORGE: I got to go.
GEORGE: I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
GEORGE: I got two tickets to see Guys And Dolls.
GEORGE: I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
GEORGE: I got used to it.
GEORGE: I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
GEORGE: I gotta buy a present now?
GEORGE: I gotta call her. Should I call her?
GEORGE: I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
GEORGE: I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
GEORGE: I gotta get out of this city.
GEORGE: I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
GEORGE: I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
GEORGE: I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
GEORGE: I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
GEORGE: I gotta go.
GEORGE: I gotta go.
GEORGE: I gotta hobble.
GEORGE: I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
GEORGE: I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
GEORGE: I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
GEORGE: I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
GEORGE: I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
GEORGE: I guess I should be, but Im not.
GEORGE: I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever
GEORGE: I guess it's not important.
GEORGE: I guess it's on my resume.
GEORGE: I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
GEORGE: I guess so.
GEORGE: I guess that leaves me in the clear...
GEORGE: I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
GEORGE: I guess you two are the lucky ones.
GEORGE: I guess... today shes late.
GEORGE: I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.
GEORGE: I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
GEORGE: I had a fight with Susan.
GEORGE: I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
GEORGE: I had a job interview.
GEORGE: I had a job interview.
GEORGE: I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
GEORGE: I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
GEORGE: I had no idea.
GEORGE: I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
GEORGE: I had the arm! Joe...
GEORGE: I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
GEORGE: I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
GEORGE: I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
GEORGE: I had to say something. I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
GEORGE: I happen to dress based on mood.
GEORGE: I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
GEORGE: I hate him!
GEORGE: I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
GEORGE: I have a fear of intimacy
GEORGE: I have a point, I have a point.
GEORGE: I have a ten.
GEORGE: I have an aunt that died at seven.
GEORGE: I have an idea.
GEORGE: I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
GEORGE: I have never seen a Mohel like that.
GEORGE: I have no choice, I'm quitting.
GEORGE: I have no idea.
GEORGE: I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
GEORGE: I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
GEORGE: I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
GEORGE: I have plants.
GEORGE: I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
GEORGE: I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
GEORGE: I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
GEORGE: I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise.
GEORGE: I have to have my tonsils taken out.
GEORGE: I have to rewind it first. Alright, alright.
GEORGE: I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
GEORGE: I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
GEORGE: I have to talk to you about something .
GEORGE: I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever!
GEORGE: I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
GEORGE: I havent seen him for months.
GEORGE: I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
GEORGE: I hear a voice.
GEORGE: I hear everything.
GEORGE: I hear thee.
GEORGE: I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
GEORGE: I heard they found a family in your freezer
GEORGE: I heard what you said: Sharon, are you there?.
GEORGE: I heard your whole conversation.
GEORGE: I hope I am.
GEORGE: I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
GEORGE: I hope so.
GEORGE: I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
GEORGE: I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
GEORGE: I I just.. but..
GEORGE: I insist. Ill fix us a drink. I got it.
GEORGE: I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
GEORGE: I just don't feel like it anymore.
GEORGE: I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
GEORGE: I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
GEORGE: I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
GEORGE: I just got fired.
GEORGE: I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
GEORGE: I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
GEORGE: I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
GEORGE: I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
GEORGE: I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
GEORGE: I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
GEORGE: I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
GEORGE: I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
GEORGE: I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
GEORGE: I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
GEORGE: I just wanted a second opinion.
GEORGE: I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
GEORGE: I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute
GEORGE: I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
GEORGE: I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
GEORGE: I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
GEORGE: I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
GEORGE: I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
GEORGE: I knew it!! I predicted it! Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played Clue! All day with this!
GEORGE: I knew it. I always felt different.
GEORGE: I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
GEORGE: I knew you had an appointment.
GEORGE: I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
GEORGE: I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
GEORGE: I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
GEORGE: I know enough to stay away from it.
GEORGE: I know I gave it to you.
GEORGE: I know I was just telling them the story.
GEORGE: I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
GEORGE: I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
GEORGE: I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
GEORGE: I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide You're not going anywhere.
GEORGE: I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
GEORGE: I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
GEORGE: I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
GEORGE: I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
GEORGE: I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. Back to work.
GEORGE: I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
GEORGE: I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
GEORGE: I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
GEORGE: I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that .
GEORGE: I know you did.
GEORGE: I know!
GEORGE: I know!
GEORGE: I know! I was squinting.
GEORGE: I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
GEORGE: I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
GEORGE: I know, but he's your son.
GEORGE: I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
GEORGE: I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
GEORGE: I know, I know, I can't stop it!
GEORGE: I know, I know, thats what they said.
GEORGE: I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
GEORGE: I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
GEORGE: I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
GEORGE: I know, sir. It won't happen again.
GEORGE: I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
GEORGE: I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
GEORGE: I know.
GEORGE: I know.
GEORGE: I know.
GEORGE: I know.
GEORGE: I know.
GEORGE: I know.
GEORGE: I know.
GEORGE: I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
GEORGE: I know. Completely bonkers!
GEORGE: I know. Don't you see. He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
GEORGE: I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
GEORGE: I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
GEORGE: I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
GEORGE: I know. I know.
GEORGE: I know. I know.
GEORGE: I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
GEORGE: I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
GEORGE: I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
GEORGE: I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
GEORGE: I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
GEORGE: I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
GEORGE: I know....
GEORGE: I learned a lot about myself.
GEORGE: I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
GEORGE: I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
GEORGE: I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
GEORGE: I like cookies.
GEORGE: I like DeSoto.
GEORGE: I like herbal tea.
GEORGE: I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
GEORGE: I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
GEORGE: I like it!
GEORGE: I like Mike Lubika.
GEORGE: I like sports. I could do something in sports.
GEORGE: I like this area. I could live out here.
GEORGE: I like to get the Daily News!
GEORGE: I like to stop at the duty free shop.
GEORGE: I like, uh...
GEORGE: I look just like him. I. Me. This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
GEORGE: I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
GEORGE: I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
GEORGE: I lost it.
GEORGE: I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
GEORGE: I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
GEORGE: I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
GEORGE: I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
GEORGE: I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
GEORGE: I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
GEORGE: I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
GEORGE: I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
GEORGE: I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
GEORGE: I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
GEORGE: I love you, Jerry.
GEORGE: I loved her!
GEORGE: I made a mistake.
GEORGE: I made him up.
GEORGE: I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
GEORGE: I mean I'm not really working right now.
GEORGE: I mean I'm the one who bought it.
GEORGE: I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
GEORGE: I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
GEORGE: I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
GEORGE: I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
GEORGE: I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
GEORGE: I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
GEORGE: I mean, how funny is this?
GEORGE: I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
GEORGE: I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
GEORGE: I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
GEORGE: I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
GEORGE: I mean, they're retired.
GEORGE: I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
GEORGE: I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
GEORGE: I mean, when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
GEORGE: I mean, you've seen her, right?
GEORGE: I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
GEORGE: I mentioned how I liked horse manure.
GEORGE: I might go there.
GEORGE: I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
GEORGE: I might.
GEORGE: I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
GEORGE: I need an outlet!
GEORGE: I need everything in there.
GEORGE: I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
GEORGE: I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
GEORGE: I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
GEORGE: I need some air..
GEORGE: I need some water. I gotta get some water.
GEORGE: I need to look for my glasses.
GEORGE: I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
GEORGE: I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
GEORGE: I never heard him say anything really funny.
GEORGE: I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
GEORGE: I never heard of that.
GEORGE: I never heard of that.
GEORGE: I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
GEORGE: I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
GEORGE: I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
GEORGE: I noticed you eh, chose the eh clowns with balloons check design.
GEORGE: I offered to pay. She should've said no.
GEORGE: I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
GEORGE: I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
GEORGE: I put my pants on, Sid.
GEORGE: I quit my job.
GEORGE: I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.TV people, and for thirty minutes a week that's pretty important to us so if you're joining us late here's some highlights from what's happened so far.
GEORGE: I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
GEORGE: I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
GEORGE: I really like those sons of bitches.
GEORGE: I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
GEORGE: I really think I should have been consulted about this.
GEORGE: I really think it looks good.
GEORGE: I really think this looks pretty good.
GEORGE: I remember..
GEORGE: I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
GEORGE: I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
GEORGE: I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
GEORGE: I said so many things.
GEORGE: I said, do you like ice?
GEORGE: I said, I said: 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
GEORGE: I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
GEORGE: I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
GEORGE: I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
GEORGE: I saw Siena again.
GEORGE: I saw them making out, you can believe it.
GEORGE: I saw Titanic. So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
GEORGE: I say fourteen o nine .
GEORGE: I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
GEORGE: I see what you mean.
GEORGE: I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
GEORGE: I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
GEORGE: I see.
GEORGE: I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
GEORGE: I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
GEORGE: I should!
GEORGE: I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
GEORGE: I shouldn't even tell you this.
GEORGE: I show up.
GEORGE: I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
GEORGE: I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?
GEORGE: I snapped! It was the last straw.
GEORGE: I sold your clothes yesterday.
GEORGE: I solve problems. That's just what I do.
GEORGE: I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
GEORGE: I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
GEORGE: I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
GEORGE: I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
GEORGE: I still have brill cream.
GEORGE: I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
GEORGE: I still haven't figured him out.
GEORGE: I still paid for it!
GEORGE: I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
GEORGE: I stopped having sex.
GEORGE: I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
GEORGE: I suppose I could just pull this out and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
GEORGE: I suppose I could.
GEORGE: I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
GEORGE: I suppose you could be an architect.
GEORGE: I swear, I swear!
GEORGE: I swear.
GEORGE: I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
GEORGE: I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the office.
GEORGE: I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
GEORGE: I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence?
GEORGE: I tell you everything, right?
GEORGE: I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, Hey he's no pig-man!
GEORGE: I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
GEORGE: I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
GEORGE: I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
GEORGE: I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
GEORGE: I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
GEORGE: I tell you; I'm wiped.
GEORGE: I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
GEORGE: I think he was impressed.
GEORGE: I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
GEORGE: I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
GEORGE: I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
GEORGE: I think I can still catch her.
GEORGE: I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING.
GEORGE: I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
GEORGE: I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
GEORGE: I think I had some hard candy in there.
GEORGE: I think I like the girl better than the voice.
GEORGE: I think I may be in love with this woman.
GEORGE: I think I saw him. I think it's him.
GEORGE: I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?!
GEORGE: I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine.
GEORGE: I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
GEORGE: I think I'll have a piece of cake.
GEORGE: I think I'm having a heart attack.
GEORGE: I think it moved.
GEORGE: I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
GEORGE: I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
GEORGE: I think it's on the wagon.
GEORGE: I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
GEORGE: I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
GEORGE: I think she finds my stupidity charming.
GEORGE: I think she likes me.
GEORGE: I think she wants me to take her home.
GEORGE: I think so.
GEORGE: I think something's happening here.
GEORGE: I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
GEORGE: I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit.
GEORGE: I think that's a good sign.
GEORGE: I think that's mine.
GEORGE: I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
GEORGE: I think that's one of mine.
GEORGE: I think that's what the back of closets are for.
GEORGE: I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
GEORGE: I think they really went for that Soda.
GEORGE: I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
GEORGE: I think this is him right here.
GEORGE: I think those are my socks!
GEORGE: I think we got a bite on it.
GEORGE: I think we have.
GEORGE: I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
GEORGE: I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
GEORGE: I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
GEORGE: I think.
GEORGE: I think.
GEORGE: I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
GEORGE: I thought he looked Irish.
GEORGE: I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
GEORGE: I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
GEORGE: I thought I saw something fly over here...
GEORGE: I thought it was a date.
GEORGE: I thought Kramer was watching.
GEORGE: I thought Mulva hated you.
GEORGE: I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
GEORGE: I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
GEORGE: I thought we'd all sign the picture.
GEORGE: I thought were a team.
GEORGE: I thought you meant the..
GEORGE: I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
GEORGE: I thought you said one oclock.
GEORGE: I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
GEORGE: I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
GEORGE: I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
GEORGE: I told her I would have to think about it.
GEORGE: I told her that she was pretentious.
GEORGE: I told her the truth.
GEORGE: I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
GEORGE: I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
GEORGE: I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
GEORGE: I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
GEORGE: I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
GEORGE: I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
GEORGE: I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
GEORGE: I told you it looked like her..
GEORGE: I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
GEORGE: I told you to stop with the hopping.
GEORGE: I told you, he probably went out the back.
GEORGE: I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
GEORGE: I told you.
GEORGE: I told you.
GEORGE: I told you.
GEORGE: I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
GEORGE: I tought I saw a face.
GEORGE: I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
GEORGE: I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
GEORGE: I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
GEORGE: I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. Susan's so attached to this thing.
GEORGE: I uh got the first name.
GEORGE: I uh, took care of that.
GEORGE: I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
GEORGE: I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
GEORGE: I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
GEORGE: I walked.
GEORGE: I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
GEORGE: I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
GEORGE: I wanna go to a tractor pull.
GEORGE: I wanna know what I did to this woman.
GEORGE: I want evens.
GEORGE: I want to know how did that get into my car?
GEORGE: I want you to find out is she likes me.
GEORGE: I want you to have this job. Of course...
GEORGE: I want your honest opinion about something.
GEORGE: I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
GEORGE: I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
GEORGE: I was curious!
GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
GEORGE: I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
GEORGE: I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, where I remained.. She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. Thank you. Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. Thanks again.
GEORGE: I was in the middle of a conversation.
GEORGE: I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
GEORGE: I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
GEORGE: I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
GEORGE: I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
GEORGE: I was just curious.
GEORGE: I was just in there. Its embarrassing.
GEORGE: I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
GEORGE: I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
GEORGE: I was naked.
GEORGE: I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
GEORGE: I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
GEORGE: I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
GEORGE: I was seven and a half.
GEORGE: I was sitting there, c'mon.
GEORGE: I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
GEORGE: I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting those raccoons.
GEORGE: I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
GEORGE: I was telling you about Noel.
GEORGE: I was there! I saw a drain!
GEORGE: I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
GEORGE: I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
GEORGE: I was trying to stick the landing. ...was right around here.
GEORGE: I was wrong, you were right.
GEORGE: I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
GEORGE: I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth.
GEORGE: I wasn't talking to you.
GEORGE: I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
GEORGE: I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
GEORGE: I went to the beach.
GEORGE: I went to the hardware store interview.
GEORGE: I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
GEORGE: I will not blow this.
GEORGE: I will, sir. Top priority.
GEORGE: I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
GEORGE: I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
GEORGE: I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
GEORGE: I won't feel like a writer.
GEORGE: I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
GEORGE: I wonder if thats really true.
GEORGE: I wonder if, ah, Susan ... No. I better just go. heh. All right! See ya.
GEORGE: I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
GEORGE: I wonder why.
GEORGE: I wont mope.
GEORGE: I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
GEORGE: I would imagine it's all naked.
GEORGE: I would like an apology.
GEORGE: I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
GEORGE: I would? What if something happens?
GEORGE: I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
GEORGE: I wouldn't mind seein' &lt;that&gt;.
GEORGE: I wouldnt think so.
GEORGE: I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.
GEORGE: I zipped up!
GEORGE: I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. Here we go, all right.
GEORGE: I'd get tired of it.
GEORGE: I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
GEORGE: I'd kill to be a 32.
GEORGE: I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
GEORGE: I'd like to be able to get it out.
GEORGE: I'd like to hear that.
GEORGE: I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
GEORGE: I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
GEORGE: I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
GEORGE: I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
GEORGE: I'd rather go to a hanging.
GEORGE: I'll be O'Brien.
GEORGE: I'll be right back.
GEORGE: I'll bet you, how much?
GEORGE: I'll call a plumber right now!
GEORGE: I'll die out here.
GEORGE: I'll drive.
GEORGE: I'll fake an illness. My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
GEORGE: I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face!
GEORGE: I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
GEORGE: I'll have 'em overnight it.
GEORGE: I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
GEORGE: I'll have the Clams Casino.
GEORGE: I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story.
GEORGE: I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
GEORGE: I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
GEORGE: I'll see you guys later.
GEORGE: I'll see you.
GEORGE: I'll see you.
GEORGE: I'll shout.
GEORGE: I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
GEORGE: I'll take care of this, Danny.
GEORGE: I'll take it in my room.
GEORGE: I'll take one. It's possible.
GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. Hey, is anybody listening?!
GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
GEORGE: I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
GEORGE: I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
GEORGE: I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
GEORGE: I'll try a piece.
GEORGE: I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
GEORGE: I'm a bad man!
GEORGE: I'm a bootlegger.
GEORGE: I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
GEORGE: I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
GEORGE: I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
GEORGE: I'm against all it's mes. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
GEORGE: I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
GEORGE: I'm all set.
GEORGE: I'm an architect.
GEORGE: I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
GEORGE: I'm as good as them.
GEORGE: I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
GEORGE: I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
GEORGE: I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
GEORGE: I'm back in business, baby!
GEORGE: I'm back, baby, I'm back!
GEORGE: I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
GEORGE: I'm better than him.
GEORGE: I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
GEORGE: I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
GEORGE: I'm calling Jerry.
GEORGE: I'm Cartwright!
GEORGE: I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
GEORGE: I'm choking!
GEORGE: I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
GEORGE: I'm Colin O'Brien.
GEORGE: I'm emotional.
GEORGE: I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
GEORGE: I'm excited about the pouty.
GEORGE: I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
GEORGE: I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
GEORGE: I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say!
GEORGE: I'm following him.
GEORGE: I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
GEORGE: I'm George.
GEORGE: I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
GEORGE: I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
GEORGE: I'm getting a makeover.
GEORGE: I'm getting married?

GEORGE: I'm interested.
GEORGE: I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
GEORGE: I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
GEORGE: I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
GEORGE: I'm just gonna...wash. WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
GEORGE: I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...

GEORGE: I'm losin' it!
GEORGE: I'm making it up.
GEORGE: I'm moving to California.

GEORGE: I'm not following.
GEORGE: I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
GEORGE: I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
GEORGE: I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
GEORGE: I'm not going back in there.
GEORGE: I'm not going if he's going.
GEORGE: I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
GEORGE: I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
GEORGE: I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
GEORGE: I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
GEORGE: I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
GEORGE: I'm not kidding, you should do it.
GEORGE: I'm not kidding.
GEORGE: I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
GEORGE: I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
GEORGE: I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...
GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...
GEORGE: I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
GEORGE: I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
GEORGE: I'm not taking a civil service test.
GEORGE: I'm not through here, Jerry. I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks.
GEORGE: I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
GEORGE: I'm not* sure.
GEORGE: I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
GEORGE: I'm on no sleep, bro.
GEORGE: I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
GEORGE: I'm Pappy.
GEORGE: I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
GEORGE: I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
GEORGE: I'm really going to do something with these three months.
GEORGE: I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
GEORGE: I'm serious.
GEORGE: I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
GEORGE: I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
GEORGE: I'm sorry I missed it.
GEORGE: I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
GEORGE: I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me.

GEORGE: I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back I-I-I'll have the clothes.
GEORGE: I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
GEORGE: I'm starting it.
GEORGE: I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
GEORGE: I'm starving...
GEORGE: I'm still here.
GEORGE: I'm still watching them.
GEORGE: I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
GEORGE: I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
GEORGE: I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
GEORGE: I'm sure I will.
GEORGE: I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
GEORGE: I'm sure you are.
GEORGE: I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
GEORGE: I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
GEORGE: I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
GEORGE: I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
GEORGE: I'm the consolation guy...?
GEORGE: I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
GEORGE: I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
GEORGE: I'm too nice.
GEORGE: I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
GEORGE: I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
GEORGE: I'm trying, dammit.
GEORGE: I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...
GEORGE: I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
GEORGE: I'm very attracted to you..
GEORGE: I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
GEORGE: I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
GEORGE: I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
GEORGE: I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
GEORGE: I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth!
GEORGE: I'm writin' it. How's it going?
GEORGE: I'm writing.
GEORGE: I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
GEORGE: I'm, you know, engaged.
GEORGE: I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
GEORGE: I've always smoked.
GEORGE: I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
GEORGE: I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
GEORGE: I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it.
GEORGE: I've been to the movies.
GEORGE: I've coupled! I've coupled!
GEORGE: I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
GEORGE: I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
GEORGE: I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.
GEORGE: I've got some plans. I got plans.
GEORGE: I've got the stub.
GEORGE: I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
GEORGE: I've gotta go to the bathroom.
GEORGE: I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
GEORGE: I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
GEORGE: I've matured.
GEORGE: I've never seen a big salad.
GEORGE: I've said that before?
GEORGE: I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
GEORGE: I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
GEORGE: I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
GEORGE: I, I can't believe this is happening!
GEORGE: I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
GEORGE: I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
GEORGE: I, I dont know.
GEORGE: I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
GEORGE: I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
GEORGE: I, I, I can't.
GEORGE: I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
GEORGE: I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
GEORGE: I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.
GEORGE: I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
GEORGE: I, uh...figure it's something.
GEORGE: I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
GEORGE: I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
GEORGE: I-I don't know.
GEORGE: I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
GEORGE: I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
GEORGE: I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
GEORGE: I-I wasn't in the attic.
GEORGE: I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
GEORGE: I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
GEORGE: I-I-I can't find my glasses.
GEORGE: I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
GEORGE: I... I... I long for you.
GEORGE: I...I wouldn't know
GEORGE: I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really, really sorry.
GEORGE: I...I..I dunno.
GEORGE: I..I..I dunno.
GEORGE: Ich bin ein sucker.
GEORGE: If anybody should be getting more it's you.
GEORGE: If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
GEORGE: If anything happens here, can I count on you?
GEORGE: If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.
GEORGE: If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
GEORGE: If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
GEORGE: If I do it, will you buy a computer?
GEORGE: If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
GEORGE: If I was a different person.
GEORGE: If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
GEORGE: If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
GEORGE: If not mine, whose?
GEORGE: If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
GEORGE: If only something like that could happen to me.
GEORGE: If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
GEORGE: If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful
GEORGE: If she'd just take a plane somewhere.
GEORGE: If that helps you..
GEORGE: If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
GEORGE: If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
GEORGE: If we decide to go at it.
GEORGE: If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
GEORGE: If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
GEORGE: If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
GEORGE: If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
GEORGE: if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen
GEORGE: If you want.
GEORGE: If you're bleak, you're bleak.
GEORGE: If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
GEORGE: If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
GEORGE: If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
GEORGE: Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
GEORGE: Implied.
GEORGE: Important step. Maybe the most important.
GEORGE: In a manner of speaking.
GEORGE: In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
GEORGE: In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
GEORGE: In every situation. No matter how silly I look. Hm.. tastes a little funky.
GEORGE: In motion. The wheels are in motion.
GEORGE: In six games.
GEORGE: In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
GEORGE: In this scene my co-star who's right over here Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
GEORGE: Innocent mistake.
GEORGE: Instinct.
GEORGE: Interesting.
GEORGE: Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
GEORGE: Into the hole?
GEORGE: Into what?
GEORGE: is getting married!
GEORGE: Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
GEORGE: Is he dead?
GEORGE: Is he still nuts?
GEORGE: Is it a clockwise swirl?
GEORGE: Is it about me?
GEORGE: Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
GEORGE: Is it that obvious?
GEORGE: Is it with a y?
GEORGE: Is it, uh, doable?
GEORGE: Is it?
GEORGE: Is it?
GEORGE: Is she socially awkward?
GEORGE: Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
GEORGE: Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
GEORGE: Is that common in our family?
GEORGE: Is that Elaine?
GEORGE: Is that good?
GEORGE: Is that how you're gonna say it?
GEORGE: Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
GEORGE: Is that it?
GEORGE: Is that right?
GEORGE: Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza: Lord of the Idiots!
GEORGE: Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
GEORGE: Is that the guy who likes fat women?
GEORGE: Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
GEORGE: Is that tolerable?
GEORGE: Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
GEORGE: Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
GEORGE: Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
GEORGE: Is there a pinkish hue?
GEORGE: Is there any money involved?
GEORGE: Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
GEORGE: Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
GEORGE: Is there something wrong with my parents?
GEORGE: Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
GEORGE: Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
GEORGE: Is yada yada bad?
GEORGE: Is your nose pierced?
GEORGE: Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
GEORGE: Isn't it?
GEORGE: Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
GEORGE: Isn't that that Bania guy?
GEORGE: Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
GEORGE: Isn't that where they remove the--
GEORGE: Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
GEORGE: It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
GEORGE: It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. Everywhere.
GEORGE: It better be.
GEORGE: It doesn't help
GEORGE: It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
GEORGE: It doesn't matter.
GEORGE: It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
GEORGE: It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
GEORGE: It happens.
GEORGE: It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
GEORGE: It is too!
GEORGE: It is. I'm just not ready yet.
GEORGE: It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
GEORGE: It just came to me.
GEORGE: It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
GEORGE: It just does.
GEORGE: It looks like it hasn't been washed.
GEORGE: It makes me look older.
GEORGE: It may have moved, I don't know.
GEORGE: It means a non-Jewish woman.
GEORGE: It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
GEORGE: It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
GEORGE: It says that on the computer?
GEORGE: It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
GEORGE: It seemed so disorganized.
GEORGE: It seems like a problem.
GEORGE: It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
GEORGE: It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said Yes! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
GEORGE: It varies.
GEORGE: It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
GEORGE: It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
GEORGE: It was a good jig.
GEORGE: It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
GEORGE: It was kinda fun. You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
GEORGE: It was Moops.
GEORGE: It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
GEORGE: It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
GEORGE: It was on CNN This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
GEORGE: It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
GEORGE: It was when I was banging!
GEORGE: It was you!
GEORGE: It was.
GEORGE: It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
GEORGE: It wasn't funny.
GEORGE: It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
GEORGE: It wasn't that bad.
GEORGE: It will be my first one.
GEORGE: It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
GEORGE: It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
GEORGE: It'll be different this time.
GEORGE: It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
GEORGE: It'll take to long.
GEORGE: It's *not* *true*!
GEORGE: It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. So any word from the pig-man?
GEORGE: It's a big flat noodle.
GEORGE: It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of Godspell with the other.
GEORGE: It's a big region.
GEORGE: It's a bit hilly - no?
GEORGE: It's a blue Honda...
GEORGE: It's a broad noodle.
GEORGE: It's a calzone, sir.
GEORGE: It's a cleaning.
GEORGE: It's a coincidence.
GEORGE: It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
GEORGE: It's a funeral procession. . . . And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
GEORGE: It's a funny observation.
GEORGE: It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
GEORGE: It's a joke.
GEORGE: It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
GEORGE: It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
GEORGE: It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom?
GEORGE: It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
GEORGE: It's a talent I have.
GEORGE: It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
GEORGE: It's about nothing.
GEORGE: It's about nothing.
GEORGE: It's about the show. It... No, it was...
GEORGE: It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. Do you know where the arrivals are?
GEORGE: It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
GEORGE: It's all politics.
GEORGE: It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
GEORGE: It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
GEORGE: It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'
GEORGE: It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
GEORGE: It's alright, I got lunch.
GEORGE: It's an early Christmas present.
GEORGE: It's an expression.
GEORGE: It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
GEORGE: It's baffling, isn't it?
GEORGE: It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
GEORGE: It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
GEORGE: It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
GEORGE: It's called a T-square.
GEORGE: It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
GEORGE: It's coming Jerry, it's coming.
GEORGE: It's complicated.
GEORGE: It's disgusting--
GEORGE: It's dismissive.
GEORGE: It's effeminate to sit like this?
GEORGE: It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
GEORGE: It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
GEORGE: It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
GEORGE: It's funny! and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
GEORGE: It's George
GEORGE: It's George
GEORGE: It's George
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's George.
GEORGE: It's GEORGE:
GEORGE: It's good, right?
GEORGE: It's good. Believe me.
GEORGE: It's Guys And *Dolls*, not Guys And *Guys*.
GEORGE: It's huge!
GEORGE: It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
GEORGE: It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
GEORGE: It's in the vault?
GEORGE: It's in... transit.
GEORGE: It's Jerry's fault.
GEORGE: It's June. Mark's Michelle is a dog.
GEORGE: It's just a magnificent stone. Jerry?
GEORGE: It's just not good, it's not good.
GEORGE: It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
GEORGE: It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
GEORGE: It's just that, I know her, and boy...
GEORGE: It's just we want you to go.
GEORGE: It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
GEORGE: It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
GEORGE: It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
GEORGE: It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
GEORGE: It's like Im thinking of something, and you're one step ahead of me.
GEORGE: It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this: Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
GEORGE: It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
GEORGE: It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
GEORGE: It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
GEORGE: It's like, all dented.
GEORGE: It's me.
GEORGE: It's mellifluous!
GEORGE: It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.
GEORGE: It's MOOPS.
GEORGE: It's Moops.
GEORGE: It's more than the meal!
GEORGE: It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
GEORGE: It's my father's car!
GEORGE: It's my head!
GEORGE: It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
GEORGE: It's my only hope.
GEORGE: It's my space!
GEORGE: It's no good.
GEORGE: It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
GEORGE: It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
GEORGE: It's not cheating if there's no sex!
GEORGE: It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
GEORGE: It's not funny, Elaine.
GEORGE: It's not him!
GEORGE: It's not me! It's the car!
GEORGE: It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
GEORGE: It's not real. They're all made up.
GEORGE: It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
GEORGE: It's not that easy. It's like Beat The Clock, there's a lot of pressure there.
GEORGE: It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
GEORGE: It's not that long, really.
GEORGE: It's not the money!
GEORGE: It's not the same.
GEORGE: It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working.
GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it..
GEORGE: It's nothing.
GEORGE: It's OK.
GEORGE: It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
GEORGE: It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
GEORGE: It's only four..
GEORGE: It's ooh As in ooh ooh ah ah.
GEORGE: It's open!
GEORGE: It's possible.
GEORGE: It's probably chocolate.
GEORGE: It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
GEORGE: It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
GEORGE: It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
GEORGE: It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
GEORGE: It's something . It's hope.
GEORGE: It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
GEORGE: It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
GEORGE: It's supposed to be a good party.
GEORGE: It's Susan
GEORGE: It's that bleak?
GEORGE: It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy.
GEORGE: It's the pesto of cities. So..?
GEORGE: It's the real deal.
GEORGE: It's the remote.
GEORGE: It's the same menu.
GEORGE: It's the same movie! What's the difference?
GEORGE: It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF:
GEORGE: It's two completely different sounds. ih and eh.
GEORGE: It's very complicated.
GEORGE: It's working already!
GEORGE: It's worth a shot.
GEORGE: It's, funny runnin' into you here.
GEORGE: It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
GEORGE: It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
GEORGE: It.
GEORGE: Italian.
GEORGE: Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
GEORGE: Its not easy.
GEORGE: Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
GEORGE: Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
GEORGE: Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
GEORGE: Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
GEORGE: Its bad?
GEORGE: Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
GEORGE: Its fabulous.
GEORGE: Its George.
GEORGE: Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
GEORGE: Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
GEORGE: Its over.
GEORGE: Its uh, it's only a few blocks.
GEORGE: Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
GEORGE: Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
GEORGE: Its wrinkled. Its worthless.
GEORGE: Its your apartment!
GEORGE: Its your decision.
GEORGE: Id like a doggie bag for this please.
GEORGE: Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
GEORGE: Id like to help, but my neck..
GEORGE: Id love to go. Make an appointment.
GEORGE: Ill be right here.
GEORGE: Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
GEORGE: Ill have the tuna.
GEORGE: Ill just, uh, get a paper...
GEORGE: Ill meet her outside the building.
GEORGE: Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
GEORGE: Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
GEORGE: Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
GEORGE: Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.
GEORGE: Im an architect.
GEORGE: Im aware of you. All right, lets go Lets go!
GEORGE: Im fine.
GEORGE: Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
GEORGE: Im good.
GEORGE: Im here helpin you.
GEORGE: Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
GEORGE: Im letting you in.
GEORGE: Im nervous.
GEORGE: Im not doing that.
GEORGE: Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. Look, they did this for me before.
GEORGE: Im not gonna watch you do laundry.
GEORGE: Im not?
GEORGE: Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
GEORGE: Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. Its only a matter of time now.
GEORGE: Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
GEORGE: Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
GEORGE: Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
GEORGE: Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
GEORGE: Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
GEORGE: Im, uh, Im an architect.
GEORGE: Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
GEORGE: Ive had my difficulties.
GEORGE: Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
GEORGE: J. Crew.
GEORGE: Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
GEORGE: Jean-Paul?
GEORGE: Jerk off.
GEORGE: Jerk!
GEORGE: Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
GEORGE: Jerry and Elaine saw you.
GEORGE: Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
GEORGE: Jerry did you wash this pear?
GEORGE: Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
GEORGE: Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
GEORGE: Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine. TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed.
GEORGE: Jerry Lewis?

I think that she thinks that she could do better Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
GEORGE: Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

GEORGE: Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
GEORGE: Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
GEORGE: Jerry, did you hear that?
GEORGE: Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?
GEORGE: Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.
GEORGE: Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
GEORGE: Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
GEORGE: Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, Teach me to sing like you.
GEORGE: Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
GEORGE: Jerry, I gotta talk to you.
GEORGE: Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
GEORGE: Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.

GEORGE: Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
GEORGE: La-la-la...
GEORGE: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
GEORGE: Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
GEORGE: Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...

GEORGE: Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
GEORGE: Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
GEORGE: Lena, how'd you meet her?
GEORGE: Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?

GEORGE: Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
GEORGE: Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
GEORGE: Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
GEORGE: Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
GEORGE: Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
GEORGE: Let me be the architect! I can do it!
GEORGE: Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
GEORGE: Let me just call him.
GEORGE: Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
GEORGE: Let me just see it for a second.
GEORGE: Let me just see it.
GEORGE: Let me put that on speaker phone.
GEORGE: Let me see that.

GEORGE: Like who?
GEORGE: Like you do.
GEORGE: Likewise.
GEORGE: Lingerie?
GEORGE: Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
GEORGE: Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
GEORGE: Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
GEORGE: Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
GEORGE: Listen to the comeback. 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
GEORGE: Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and yada yada yada, I'm really tired today. You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
GEORGE: Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
GEORGE: Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
GEORGE: Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
GEORGE: Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
GEORGE: Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
GEORGE: Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?

GEORGE: Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. This is guts.
GEORGE: Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
GEORGE: Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. You gave me ladies' frames!
GEORGE: Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
GEORGE: Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
GEORGE: Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?

GEORGE: Little baked beans

GEORGE: Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
GEORGE: Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
GEORGE: Look at that. Theyre done!
GEORGE: Look at the time, that's it.
GEORGE: Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, Ill walk out of here right now!
GEORGE: look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
GEORGE: Look at this sparkle. Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
GEORGE: Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?

GEORGE: Look at where we are! He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! We're not in the first row?
GEORGE: Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
GEORGE: Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
GEORGE: Look it's no secret what's going on between us. She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
GEORGE: Look who's here!
GEORGE: Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
GEORGE: Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
GEORGE: Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
GEORGE: Look, I guarantee she won't know.
GEORGE: Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
GEORGE: Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
GEORGE: Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
GEORGE: Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
GEORGE: Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
GEORGE: Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the party!
GEORGE: Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
GEORGE: Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.

GEORGE: Looks like veal.

Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
GEORGE: No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?

GEORGE: No sir.
GEORGE: No sir.
GEORGE: No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
GEORGE: No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
GEORGE: No thanks.
GEORGE: No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased.
GEORGE: No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
GEORGE: No way.
GEORGE: No we're not.
GEORGE: No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
GEORGE: No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring.
GEORGE: No!
GEORGE: No!
GEORGE: No!
GEORGE: No!
GEORGE: No!
GEORGE: No! Absolutely Not!
GEORGE: No! Check! Please.
GEORGE: No! Get out of here, Newman.
GEORGE: No! Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
GEORGE: No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
GEORGE: No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
GEORGE: No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
GEORGE: No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
GEORGE: No! Jerry! W
GEORGE: No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
GEORGE: No! No!
GEORGE: No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! I hate Festivus!
GEORGE: No! No!!
GEORGE: No! No.
GEORGE: No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
GEORGE: No! Tell her.
GEORGE: No! Theres no coconut!
GEORGE: NO!!
GEORGE: No!...not...nothing.
GEORGE: No, an old friend of ours, Gary.
GEORGE: No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
GEORGE: No, anything.
GEORGE: No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
GEORGE: No, but Im very uncomfortable.
GEORGE: No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
GEORGE: No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
GEORGE: No, can't say as I did.
GEORGE: No, don't call her.
GEORGE: No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
GEORGE: No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
GEORGE: No, he isn't.
GEORGE: No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
GEORGE: No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
GEORGE: No, her too. And her mother.
GEORGE: No, I brought a picture of the chair.
GEORGE: No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye.
GEORGE: No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
GEORGE: No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
GEORGE: No, I did not!
GEORGE: No, I didn't hear anything.
GEORGE: No, I didn't.
GEORGE: No, I don't have any change.
GEORGE: No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
GEORGE: No, I don't have it yet.
GEORGE: No, I don't know who was doing that.
GEORGE: No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
GEORGE: No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
GEORGE: No, I dont care.
GEORGE: No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
GEORGE: No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
GEORGE: No, I froze.
GEORGE: No, I got my own place.
GEORGE: No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
GEORGE: No, I saw Home Alone II.
GEORGE: No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
GEORGE: No, I uh...
GEORGE: No, I uh... I use it.
GEORGE: No, I want to go.
GEORGE: No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
GEORGE: No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
GEORGE: No, I won't.
GEORGE: No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him.
GEORGE: No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
GEORGE: No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
GEORGE: No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!
GEORGE: No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
GEORGE: No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
GEORGE: No, I-I-I know... I know...
GEORGE: No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.
GEORGE: No, impossible! Its your apartment.
GEORGE: No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
GEORGE: No, it isn't.
GEORGE: No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run.
GEORGE: No, it's about nothing.
GEORGE: No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
GEORGE: No, it's not.
GEORGE: No, it's not.
GEORGE: No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married.
GEORGE: No, it's, it's his.
GEORGE: No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
GEORGE: No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
GEORGE: No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
GEORGE: No, Jerry, don't call.
GEORGE: No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
GEORGE: No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
GEORGE: No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye.
GEORGE: No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
GEORGE: No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
GEORGE: No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist..
GEORGE: No, never mind.
GEORGE: No, Newman, stop it.
GEORGE: No, no I do. You know it's just...
GEORGE: No, no I don't think so.
GEORGE: No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
GEORGE: No, no she wasn't.
GEORGE: No, no thanks.
GEORGE: No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
GEORGE: No, no that's ah, that's pie country.
GEORGE: No, no the full size.
GEORGE: No, no you really look great.
GEORGE: No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
GEORGE: No, no! You can't throw me out
GEORGE: No, no,
GEORGE: No, no,
GEORGE: No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
GEORGE: No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
GEORGE: No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
GEORGE: No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
GEORGE: No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
GEORGE: No, no, no Elaine.
GEORGE: No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.
GEORGE: No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
GEORGE: No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
GEORGE: No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
GEORGE: No, no, no, this suit is not for sale.
GEORGE: No, no, no. He just left.
GEORGE: No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, what is chicken Kiev, I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
GEORGE: No, no, no. Nothing happens.
GEORGE: No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
GEORGE: No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
GEORGE: No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run.
GEORGE: No, no, pff...
GEORGE: No, no, she might just think its a gift.
GEORGE: No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
GEORGE: No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
GEORGE: No, no, what, what?
GEORGE: No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
GEORGE: No, No.
GEORGE: No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
GEORGE: No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
GEORGE: No, no. Hes just being modest.
GEORGE: No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
GEORGE: No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
GEORGE: No, no. I'm just thinking.
GEORGE: No, no. I'm not going on.
GEORGE: No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
GEORGE: No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
GEORGE: No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
GEORGE: No, no. No, no, no. We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
GEORGE: No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
GEORGE: No, no...
GEORGE: No, no....
GEORGE: No, no...I hate the condom.
GEORGE: No, not a loser!
GEORGE: No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
GEORGE: No, not at all...
GEORGE: No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
GEORGE: No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. I can't do this! Can't do this!
GEORGE: No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
GEORGE: No, not really.
GEORGE: No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
GEORGE: No, not that I know of.
GEORGE: No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
GEORGE: No, of course not.
GEORGE: No, of course not. I didnt-
GEORGE: No, of course not...
GEORGE: No, really. No, no, thanks.
GEORGE: No, say. I want you to say.
GEORGE: No, Seven.
GEORGE: No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
GEORGE: No, she wasn't on the horse.
GEORGE: No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
GEORGE: No, something's off here, you hesitated.
GEORGE: No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
GEORGE: No, tell me.
GEORGE: No, thanks.
GEORGE: No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... Jerry, yeah. Jerry's a friend of mine. He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
GEORGE: No, that's it.
GEORGE: No, that's Jerry.
GEORGE: No, that's me.
GEORGE: No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
GEORGE: No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
GEORGE: No, that's not it at all.
GEORGE: No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
GEORGE: No, that's the Netherlands.
GEORGE: No, the cushion's turned over.
GEORGE: No, the Portuguese waitress.
GEORGE: No, there'll be girls there.
GEORGE: No, they had plans.
GEORGE: No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
GEORGE: No, we're not. We're not men.
GEORGE: No, what is it?
GEORGE: No, what?
GEORGE: No, why, what's happening?
GEORGE: No, you can have it.
GEORGE: No, you didn't mention it.
GEORGE: No, you didnt!
GEORGE: No, YOU do!
GEORGE: No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
GEORGE: No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
GEORGE: No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
GEORGE: No, you said you didn't like it...
GEORGE: No, you see? You got greedy.
GEORGE: No, you wont.
GEORGE: No, you're crushing my sandwich.
GEORGE: No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
GEORGE: No, you're not a divorcee. Youÿre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
GEORGE: No, you're not out there.
GEORGE: No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
GEORGE: No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
GEORGE: No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
GEORGE: No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
GEORGE: No.
GEORGE: No.
GEORGE: No.
GEORGE: No.
GEORGE: No.
GEORGE: No.

GEORGE: No.
GEORGE: No.
GEORGE: No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
GEORGE: No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
GEORGE: No. Believe me, he's not.
GEORGE: No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
GEORGE: No. Definitely not.
GEORGE: No. During.
GEORGE: No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
GEORGE: No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
GEORGE: No. I did.
GEORGE: No. I didn't get it.
GEORGE: No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
GEORGE: No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
GEORGE: No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
GEORGE: No. I--I paid for it.
GEORGE: No. It didn't take.
GEORGE: No. Just imagine her reaction.
GEORGE: No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.
GEORGE: No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
GEORGE: No. No T-bone.
GEORGE: No. No way.
GEORGE: No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
GEORGE: No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
GEORGE: No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
GEORGE: No. Nothing. Fine.
GEORGE: No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
GEORGE: No. Rice and caramel.
GEORGE: No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
GEORGE: No. She tried to give me the it's not you, it's me routine.
GEORGE: No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
GEORGE: No. Thanks, dad.
GEORGE: No. That's disgusting!
GEORGE: No. That's just electric.
GEORGE: No. That's not that.
GEORGE: No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. Will you stop it? Oh. Of course. Polyester!
GEORGE: No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
GEORGE: No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, Hi. I'm
GEORGE: No. You dip the way you want to dip... I'll dip the way I want to dip.
GEORGE: No..
GEORGE: No...
GEORGE: No...
GEORGE: No... What guy?
GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
GEORGE: No...Why should that make any difference to you?
GEORGE: No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
GEORGE: No?
GEORGE: No?
GEORGE: No? Are you crazy?
GEORGE: Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
GEORGE: Nobody tucks anymore.
GEORGE: Nobody's faking.
GEORGE: Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
GEORGE: Noo!
GEORGE: Nooo...
GEORGE: Nooooo.
GEORGE: Nooooooo......
GEORGE: Nope!
GEORGE: Nope!
GEORGE: Nope, no can do.
GEORGE: Nope.
GEORGE: Nope. I wept like a baby.
GEORGE: Nose. What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed?
GEORGE: Not a bad way to make a buck.
GEORGE: Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
GEORGE: Not a plane crash. Is it a plane crash?
GEORGE: Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
GEORGE: Not as thin as you think.
GEORGE: Not at all.
GEORGE: Not at all.
GEORGE: Not bad? It's gorgeous!
GEORGE: Not bills.
GEORGE: Not even an apple.
GEORGE: Not even close, huh?
GEORGE: Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. Do you know what the crop circles are?
GEORGE: Not exactly. What does that mean?
GEORGE: Not in the last fifteen minutes.
GEORGE: Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
GEORGE: Not me.
GEORGE: Not necessarily.
GEORGE: Not necessarily.
GEORGE: Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
GEORGE: Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
GEORGE: Not now Florice.
GEORGE: Not now.
GEORGE: Not possible.
GEORGE: Not quite.
GEORGE: Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch.
GEORGE: Not that Im aware of, no.
GEORGE: Not that much.
GEORGE: Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
GEORGE: Not the feats of strength..
GEORGE: Not the point!
GEORGE: Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
GEORGE: Not yet, but she's weakening.
GEORGE: Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
GEORGE: Not you.
GEORGE: Not.
GEORGE: Not.
GEORGE: nothing
GEORGE: Nothing at all.
GEORGE: Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
GEORGE: Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
GEORGE: Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
GEORGE: Nothing!
GEORGE: Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
GEORGE: Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing.
GEORGE: Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
GEORGE: Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
GEORGE: Nothing. It's not YOU..
GEORGE: Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
GEORGE: Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
GEORGE: Now everyone's going to think we're gay!
GEORGE: Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
GEORGE: Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
GEORGE: Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
GEORGE: Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
GEORGE: Now Im in the worst position of all.
GEORGE: Now let's try breast... Celeste... Kest...
GEORGE: Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
GEORGE: Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
GEORGE: Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
GEORGE: Now you're off on a topic.
GEORGE: Now, a woman calls me, all right?
GEORGE: Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
GEORGE: Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
GEORGE: Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
GEORGE: Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
GEORGE: Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
GEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer Vandelay Industries.
GEORGE: Now, see here, doctor.
GEORGE: Now, stop it ...
GEORGE: Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
GEORGE: Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
GEORGE: Now?
GEORGE: Now?! I'm a mutant!
GEORGE: Nowhere.
GEORGE: Nucleosis.
GEORGE: O.K., Danny, take a swing. N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
GEORGE: O.k....
GEORGE: O.k.... I think I know where we can get one.
GEORGE: Obviously.
GEORGE: Obviously.
GEORGE: Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
GEORGE: Of course he liked it.
GEORGE: Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
GEORGE: Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
GEORGE: Of course I do.
GEORGE: Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
GEORGE: Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. Like this. Since the fourth grade.
GEORGE: Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
GEORGE: Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
GEORGE: Of Course I'm telling the truth.
GEORGE: Of course it is.
GEORGE: Of course it is.
GEORGE: Of course it's cashemere.
GEORGE: Of course it's cashmere.
GEORGE: Of course it's cashmere.
GEORGE: Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
GEORGE: Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
GEORGE: Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
GEORGE: Of course not...
GEORGE: Of course there's something wrong! We had a pact!
GEORGE: Of course you can.
GEORGE: Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
GEORGE: Of course you do.
GEORGE: Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
GEORGE: Of course you will. . You're the best.
GEORGE: Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
GEORGE: Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know.
GEORGE: Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
GEORGE: Of course, right.
GEORGE: Of course, the uh, the four passes. Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
GEORGE: Of course.
GEORGE: Of course.
GEORGE: Of course.
GEORGE: Of course.
GEORGE: Of course. Absolute zero!
GEORGE: Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
GEORGE: Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
GEORGE: Of course. We all do.
GEORGE: Of course. Your massage. Enjoy your massage.
GEORGE: Off the wagon?
GEORGE: Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
GEORGE: Officer, could I just explain something to you?
GEORGE: Officer, he can't pull in head first.
GEORGE: Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
GEORGE: Oh - I've got something.
GEORGE: Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
GEORGE: Oh are they gonna be furious.
GEORGE: Oh Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
GEORGE: Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
GEORGE: Oh boy.
GEORGE: Oh boy.
GEORGE: Oh boy.
GEORGE: Oh boy..
GEORGE: Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
GEORGE: Oh don't-
GEORGE: Oh geeeee. Go, go!
GEORGE: Oh God, Mommy!
GEORGE: Oh god.
GEORGE: Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
GEORGE: Oh good.
GEORGE: Oh great.
GEORGE: Oh great.
GEORGE: Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
GEORGE: Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
GEORGE: Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
GEORGE: Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
GEORGE: Oh I got it. That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
GEORGE: Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
GEORGE: Oh I missed the Maestro?
GEORGE: Oh I think I'd go for the back.
GEORGE: Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
GEORGE: Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
GEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.
GEORGE: Oh I'm going baby! I'm going!
GEORGE: Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
GEORGE: Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
GEORGE: Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
GEORGE: Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
GEORGE: Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
GEORGE: Oh man.
GEORGE: Oh mother of God.
GEORGE: Oh my god he's not kidding.
GEORGE: Oh my God it is them.
GEORGE: Oh my God!
GEORGE: Oh my God! What is that?!
GEORGE: Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
GEORGE: OH MY GOD!!!
GEORGE: Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
GEORGE: Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
GEORGE: Oh my God, I forgot!
GEORGE: Oh my God, it's 7:01. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
GEORGE: Oh my God, its exactly the same!
GEORGE: Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
GEORGE: Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
GEORGE: Oh my God.
GEORGE: Oh my God.
GEORGE: Oh my God.
GEORGE: Oh my god.
GEORGE: Oh my god.
GEORGE: Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya.
GEORGE: Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
GEORGE: Oh my God..
GEORGE: Oh my god....
GEORGE: Oh my God...You're in jail? That is so cool!
GEORGE: Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
GEORGE: Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
GEORGE: Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
GEORGE: Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
GEORGE: Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
GEORGE: Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
GEORGE: Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
GEORGE: Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
GEORGE: Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
GEORGE: Oh no, I am down!
GEORGE: Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
GEORGE: Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
GEORGE: Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
GEORGE: Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...
GEORGE: Oh no, thank you.
GEORGE: Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
GEORGE: Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
GEORGE: Oh of course you can use it, sure. Ok, bye.
GEORGE: Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
GEORGE: Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...
GEORGE: Oh please.
GEORGE: Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
GEORGE: Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
GEORGE: Oh right, the blind date.
GEORGE: Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway?
GEORGE: Oh shut up.
GEORGE: Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant.. you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling.
GEORGE: Oh thank you.
GEORGE: Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
GEORGE: Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
GEORGE: Oh the ego on you.
GEORGE: Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
GEORGE: oh Tony don't
GEORGE: Oh uh hi Hi, David
GEORGE: Oh uh. You ready?
GEORGE: Oh uuh, sure, why not. Hey, that's the guy.
GEORGE: Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
GEORGE: Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...
GEORGE: Oh well, that's, uh, thatís just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
GEORGE: Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
GEORGE: Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
GEORGE: Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
GEORGE: Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
GEORGE: Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
GEORGE: Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
GEORGE: Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
GEORGE: Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.
GEORGE: Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
GEORGE: Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best.
GEORGE: Oh yeah, like you know.
GEORGE: Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
GEORGE: Oh yeah, Reilly? Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
GEORGE: Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?
GEORGE: Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
GEORGE: Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.
GEORGE: Oh yeah.
GEORGE: Oh yeah.
GEORGE: Oh yeah.
GEORGE: Oh yeah.
GEORGE: Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
GEORGE: Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
GEORGE: Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
GEORGE: Oh yeah.. Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
GEORGE: Oh yeah: HA-A-A, HA-A-A.
GEORGE: Oh yeah?
GEORGE: Oh yeeah.. well, Big smoker... I gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
GEORGE: Oh yes I am
GEORGE: Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
GEORGE: Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
GEORGE: Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...
GEORGE: Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair.
GEORGE: Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
GEORGE: Oh you mean face down on her chest.
GEORGE: Oh you mother...
GEORGE: Oh you told her didn't you.
GEORGE: Oh!
GEORGE: Oh!
GEORGE: Oh!
GEORGE: Oh! Dropped a napkin... Jerry!
GEORGE: Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
GEORGE: Oh! Great!
GEORGE: Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
GEORGE: Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
GEORGE: Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
GEORGE: Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....
GEORGE: Oh! my god. Oh! man...
GEORGE: Oh! my god...
GEORGE: Oh! no no nothing....
GEORGE: Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
GEORGE: Oh! Okay.
GEORGE: Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
GEORGE: Oh! you taped it?
GEORGE: OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
GEORGE: Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable
GEORGE: Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. What is this? Why am I itching?
GEORGE: oh,
GEORGE: Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
GEORGE: oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
GEORGE: Oh, ... some stupid movie...
GEORGE: Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
GEORGE: Oh, boy. Here she comes.
GEORGE: Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor: pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
GEORGE: Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
GEORGE: Oh, come on! Be sensible.
GEORGE: Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
GEORGE: Oh, come on, it's five minutes.
GEORGE: Oh, come on, you're good at this.
GEORGE: Oh, come on.
GEORGE: Oh, come on. What, are you kidding?
GEORGE: Oh, cmon, Jerry. I cant believe this.
GEORGE: Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
GEORGE: Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
GEORGE: Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
GEORGE: Oh, every chance I get.
GEORGE: Oh, get outta here.
GEORGE: Oh, get outta here.
GEORGE: Oh, God.
GEORGE: Oh, god. Look who's here.
GEORGE: Oh, God...
GEORGE: Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
GEORGE: Oh, great guy.
GEORGE: Oh, great.
GEORGE: Oh, he stole it!
GEORGE: Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
GEORGE: Oh, hello Professor.
GEORGE: Oh, hello, Hanke, others.
GEORGE: Oh, hello, it's you! Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
GEORGE: Oh, here we go...
GEORGE: Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
GEORGE: Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
GEORGE: Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.
GEORGE: Oh, hes the comedian.
GEORGE: Oh, Hi, I'm George.
GEORGE: Oh, hi..
GEORGE: Oh, hi...
GEORGE: Oh, Huh, imagine that.
GEORGE: Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
GEORGE: Oh, I could do it.
GEORGE: Oh, I don't know.
GEORGE: Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
GEORGE: Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
GEORGE: Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
GEORGE: Oh, I got it.
GEORGE: Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
GEORGE: Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
GEORGE: Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
GEORGE: Oh, I know.
GEORGE: Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
GEORGE: Oh, I pleaded with him.
GEORGE: Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
GEORGE: Oh, I sure hope so.
GEORGE: Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
GEORGE: Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
GEORGE: Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
GEORGE: Oh, I understand. Hey.
GEORGE: Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... had company. Hiya, I'm George.
GEORGE: Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
GEORGE: Oh, I was trying to make a point.
GEORGE: Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
GEORGE: Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
GEORGE: Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
GEORGE: Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
GEORGE: Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
GEORGE: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry..
GEORGE: Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
GEORGE: Oh, I, uh--
GEORGE: Oh, it had to happen!!
GEORGE: Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
GEORGE: Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', These are my friends?!
GEORGE: Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.
GEORGE: Oh, it's good.
GEORGE: Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
GEORGE: Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
GEORGE: Oh, it's locked?
GEORGE: Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.
GEORGE: Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...
GEORGE: Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
GEORGE: Oh, its a lovely song. How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
GEORGE: Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
GEORGE: Oh, Im crazy!
GEORGE: Oh, Im Im full of it Father.
GEORGE: Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
GEORGE: Oh, like you really know busboys.
GEORGE: Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
GEORGE: Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
GEORGE: Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
GEORGE: Oh, me, me, me, me, me!
GEORGE: Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
GEORGE: Oh, my god!
GEORGE: Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
GEORGE: Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!
GEORGE: Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
GEORGE: Oh, my God.
GEORGE: Oh, my god.
GEORGE: Oh, my God..
GEORGE: Oh, my God...
GEORGE: Oh, my God...
GEORGE: Oh, n-no comparison.
GEORGE: Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
GEORGE: Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
GEORGE: Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
GEORGE: Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
GEORGE: Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
GEORGE: Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
GEORGE: Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
GEORGE: Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
GEORGE: Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
GEORGE: Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
GEORGE: Oh, no, no--
GEORGE: Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
GEORGE: Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
GEORGE: Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
GEORGE: Oh, no, nothing.
GEORGE: Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
GEORGE: Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
GEORGE: Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
GEORGE: Oh, no.
GEORGE: Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
GEORGE: Oh, no. No no no no.
GEORGE: Oh, no. No stories.
GEORGE: Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
GEORGE: Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. Watch it, funny man.
GEORGE: Oh, no. We left on good terms.
GEORGE: Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
GEORGE: Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
GEORGE: Oh, not more building.
GEORGE: Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
GEORGE: Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
GEORGE: Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
GEORGE: Oh, nothing.
GEORGE: Oh, nothing...
GEORGE: Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...?
GEORGE: Oh, of course. Of course.
GEORGE: Oh, oh!
GEORGE: Oh, oh, your papers
GEORGE: Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
GEORGE: Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
GEORGE: Oh, okay.
GEORGE: Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
GEORGE: Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
GEORGE: Oh, please don't.
GEORGE: Oh, please, somebody, stop this!
GEORGE: Oh, please. Can you change this into bills?
GEORGE: Oh, pretty good.
GEORGE: Oh, pudding! You want some?
GEORGE: Oh, real good. Any word from NBC?
GEORGE: Oh, right! Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment.
GEORGE: Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
GEORGE: Oh, right. Oh no, man.
GEORGE: Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. Sweetie. Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? I thought I was getting the butler.
GEORGE: Oh, Safire. Uh ha
GEORGE: Oh, Schumann. Of course.
GEORGE: Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
GEORGE: Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
GEORGE: Oh, share.
GEORGE: Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
GEORGE: Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
GEORGE: Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
GEORGE: Oh, shhh.
GEORGE: Oh, shut up!
GEORGE: Oh, so it backfired?
GEORGE: Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
GEORGE: Oh, so you don't believe me either?
GEORGE: Oh, sorry.
GEORGE: Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
GEORGE: Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
GEORGE: Oh, sure.
GEORGE: Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
GEORGE: Oh, sure. Of course. Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
GEORGE: Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
GEORGE: Oh, Tara!
GEORGE: Oh, thank you very much.
GEORGE: Oh, thank you.
GEORGE: Oh, thank you.
GEORGE: Oh, thank you.
GEORGE: Oh, thanks, Bobby. Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
GEORGE: Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
GEORGE: Oh, that would be wonderful.
GEORGE: Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
GEORGE: Oh, that's bad. That's bad.
GEORGE: Oh, that's funny
GEORGE: Oh, that's good. That's very good.
GEORGE: Oh, that's me.
GEORGE: Oh, that's nice.
GEORGE: Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
GEORGE: Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
GEORGE: Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
GEORGE: Oh, that's wonderful.
GEORGE: Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
GEORGE: Oh, the actress-waitress?
GEORGE: Oh, the big race.
GEORGE: Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
GEORGE: Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
GEORGE: Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.
GEORGE: Oh, the hamstrings fine.
GEORGE: Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
GEORGE: Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
GEORGE: Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
GEORGE: Oh, the virgin?
GEORGE: Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well,
GEORGE: Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
GEORGE: Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
GEORGE: Oh, there's better, right there, that's better.
GEORGE: Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
GEORGE: Oh, they're busting!
GEORGE: Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
GEORGE: Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in!
GEORGE: Oh, this is fabulous.
GEORGE: Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
GEORGE: Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
GEORGE: Oh, this is great.
GEORGE: Oh, this is huge!
GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend Jerry.
GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
GEORGE: Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
GEORGE: Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
GEORGE: Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.
GEORGE: Oh, uh, the cigars.. I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
GEORGE: Oh, uh, The Falconer by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
GEORGE: Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Is this about money?
GEORGE: Oh, uh...
GEORGE: Oh, very gracious.
GEORGE: Oh, very refreshing. Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
GEORGE: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
GEORGE: Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
GEORGE: Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
GEORGE: Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
GEORGE: Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
GEORGE: Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money.
GEORGE: Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
GEORGE: Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
GEORGE: Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going Ha, ha!? What is that? Ha, ha!?
GEORGE: Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
GEORGE: Oh, well...
GEORGE: Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
GEORGE: Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
GEORGE: Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
GEORGE: Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
GEORGE: Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
GEORGE: Oh, when is that car service coming?
GEORGE: Oh, would ya stop worrying?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. So how about that Kramer, huh?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancée, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
GEORGE: Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
GEORGE: Oh, yes of course, come in.
GEORGE: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.
GEORGE: Oh, yes. Hello.
GEORGE: Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
GEORGE: Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
GEORGE: Oh, you are such a wuss.
GEORGE: Oh, you do?
GEORGE: Oh, you have a policy! The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
GEORGE: Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
GEORGE: Oh, you hesitated.
GEORGE: Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
GEORGE: Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
GEORGE: Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
GEORGE: Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
GEORGE: Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
GEORGE: Oh, you want to taste mine.
GEORGE: Oh, you're dead.
GEORGE: Oh, you're fine... you're fine. So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
GEORGE: Oh, you're in here.
GEORGE: Oh-ho, yeah?
GEORGE: Oh-ohf yeah, I'm a writer.
GEORGE: Oh.
GEORGE: Oh.
GEORGE: Oh.

GEORGE: Oh.
GEORGE: Oh. Course not.
GEORGE: Oh. How's she doing?
GEORGE: Oh. How's the guy?
GEORGE: Oh. I know they have some monies.
GEORGE: Oh. It's just horse manure Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
GEORGE: Oh. Oh!
GEORGE: Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. What're you having, veal?
GEORGE: Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there?
GEORGE: Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
GEORGE: Oh. Really.
GEORGE: Oh. Sorry.
GEORGE: Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
GEORGE: Oh. That's good.
GEORGE: Oh. The summer me.
GEORGE: Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
GEORGE: Oh. What is this?
GEORGE: Oh. Who is this guy?
GEORGE: Oh. You still wanna go?
GEORGE: Oh..
GEORGE: oh..
GEORGE: Oh.. nice.
GEORGE: Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
GEORGE: Oh...
GEORGE: Oh... ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
GEORGE: Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
GEORGE: Oh... make it stop.
GEORGE: Oh...pretty good.
GEORGE: Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. Did I leer?
GEORGE: Oh...you're very good.
GEORGE: Ohh, hey there, young fella. What's your major?
GEORGE: Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
GEORGE: Ohh, I wanted to see that. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
GEORGE: Ohh, yeahh.
GEORGE: Ohh.. Paco! Hey, take a look at this.
GEORGE: Ohhhh...
GEORGE: Ohhhhhh
GEORGE: Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
GEORGE: OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
GEORGE: Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
GEORGE: Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
GEORGE: Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
GEORGE: Ok, it's a deal!
GEORGE: Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
GEORGE: OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
GEORGE: Ok, so, what'dya got?
GEORGE: Ok, thanks.
GEORGE: Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
GEORGE: Ok, what did you say?
GEORGE: Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
GEORGE: Okay! Alright!
GEORGE: Okay, all right, all right.
GEORGE: Okay, go ahead.
GEORGE: Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
GEORGE: Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
GEORGE: Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
GEORGE: Okay, I mean it's serious but--
GEORGE: Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
GEORGE: Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
GEORGE: Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
GEORGE: Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
GEORGE: Okay, the point is made.
GEORGE: Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
GEORGE: Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. Right?
GEORGE: Okay, we'll go!
GEORGE: Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
GEORGE: Okay, what are we gonna do?
GEORGE: Okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
GEORGE: Okay.

GEORGE: Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
GEORGE: Okay. How about this?
GEORGE: Okay. Now, why do I have to see you?
GEORGE: Okay. OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
GEORGE: Okay. Okay. Fine.
GEORGE: Okay. Thanks anyway.
GEORGE: Okay. That's what we know.
GEORGE: Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh, Elaine?
GEORGE: Olive?
GEORGE: On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
GEORGE: on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! Ha ha!
GEORGE: On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
GEORGE: Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. the lamp.
GEORGE: Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
GEORGE: One left...what a joke.
GEORGE: One little bite.
GEORGE: One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
GEORGE: One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
GEORGE: One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
GEORGE: One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
GEORGE: One would hope.
GEORGE: One, two ... three, four.
GEORGE: One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.

GEORGE: OOuuoo! They could use the break!
GEORGE: Operator? Beijing?
GEORGE: Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
GEORGE: Or something. I said, Or Something!
GEORGE: Or we could get them together. Woo!
GEORGE: Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger.
GEORGE: Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
GEORGE: Ouch!
GEORGE: Our show, Jerry?
GEORGE: Out of the question.
GEORGE: Out of the question. Out of the question!
GEORGE: Out. Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
GEORGE: Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.

GEORGE: People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
GEORGE: People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
GEORGE: People think they're so important...
GEORGE: People who do that should be arrested.
GEORGE: Pepe.
GEORGE: Percentage?
GEORGE: Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
GEORGE: Perhaps.
GEORGE: Perhaps. I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.

GEORGE: Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.

GEORGE: Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
GEORGE: Playground equipment.
GEORGE: Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way.
GEORGE: please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
GEORGE: Please! I have so little!
GEORGE: Please, doctor.
GEORGE: Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
GEORGE: Please, it's not necessary.

GEORGE: Please.
GEORGE: Please.
GEORGE: Please.
GEORGE: Please. Give me another chance.

GEORGE: Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
GEORGE: Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
GEORGE: Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.

GEORGE: Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...

GEORGE: Pssh. Yeah. Right.
GEORGE: Psst, You're telling me.

GEORGE: Pudding skin singles.
GEORGE: Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.

GEORGE: Really?
GEORGE: Really?
GEORGE: Really?
GEORGE: Really?
GEORGE: Really?
GEORGE: Really?
GEORGE: Really? ..You think.
GEORGE: Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!

GEORGE: Really? What does it mean?
GEORGE: Really? What happened?
GEORGE: Really? Who?
GEORGE: Really? Why?
GEORGE: Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.

GEORGE: Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
GEORGE: Really? You wanna come?
GEORGE: Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
GEORGE: Regards?
GEORGE: Reilly is no longer with the club. You believe that?
GEORGE: Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
GEORGE: Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
GEORGE: Remember when you came to audition for us?
GEORGE: Remember, dont take any crap.
GEORGE: Reparations!
GEORGE: Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
GEORGE: Rest stop supply.
GEORGE: Rest... Sest... Hest...
GEORGE: Revenge.
GEORGE: Rick.
GEORGE: Rick.
GEORGE: Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
GEORGE: Ridiculous!
GEORGE: Right
GEORGE: Right above you?
GEORGE: Right here.
GEORGE: Right now?
GEORGE: Right now? Jerry?
GEORGE: Right out of the clear blue sky?
GEORGE: Right!
GEORGE: Right!
GEORGE: Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
GEORGE: Right, alright. Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
GEORGE: Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
GEORGE: Right, gotta get going.
GEORGE: Right, I got news. You ready? Gary Fogel had cancer.
GEORGE: Right, I knew I felt something!
GEORGE: Right, ready?
GEORGE: Right, right.
GEORGE: Right, your friend Roy.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right.
GEORGE: Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
GEORGE: Right. Bye.
GEORGE: Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
GEORGE: Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
GEORGE: Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
GEORGE: Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
GEORGE: Right. Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
GEORGE: Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
GEORGE: Right. The other members of our party. Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
GEORGE: Right.. the sign.
GEORGE: Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
GEORGE: Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
GEORGE: Robin? Robin!
GEORGE: Ross'.
GEORGE: Rosses.
GEORGE: Rosses.
GEORGE: Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
GEORGE: rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
GEORGE: S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
GEORGE: S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
GEORGE: S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
GEORGE: S-Susan
GEORGE: Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
GEORGE: Same thing!
GEORGE: Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
GEORGE: Sand. It's everywhere
GEORGE: Say good-bye to Koko.
GEORGE: Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
GEORGE: Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
GEORGE: Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
GEORGE: Say? What? Nothing, I...
GEORGE: Scissor. Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
GEORGE: Screw the Drake!
GEORGE: See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
GEORGE: See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
GEORGE: See now this I don't get.
GEORGE: See ya later.
GEORGE: See ya.
GEORGE: See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
GEORGE: See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
GEORGE: See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
GEORGE: See, It's not so hard.
GEORGE: See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
GEORGE: See, this should be a show. This is the show.
GEORGE: See?
GEORGE: See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
GEORGE: Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
GEORGE: Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
GEORGE: Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
GEORGE: Senegal?
GEORGE: Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
GEORGE: SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
GEORGE: Seven forty-five.
GEORGE: Seven!!
GEORGE: Seven-eight-four.
GEORGE: Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
GEORGE: Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away.
GEORGE: Shadow!
GEORGE: Shake his hand?
GEORGE: Shall we say an hour.
GEORGE: She any good?
GEORGE: She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
GEORGE: She asked me to.
GEORGE: She ate breakfast naked?
GEORGE: She bought.
GEORGE: She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
GEORGE: She called Susan last night.
GEORGE: She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
GEORGE: She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
GEORGE: She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
GEORGE: She cant kill me right?
GEORGE: She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
GEORGE: She confused six with sex?
GEORGE: She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
GEORGE: She did. Today.
GEORGE: She didn't help him?
GEORGE: She didn't like me?
GEORGE: She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
GEORGE: She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
GEORGE: She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
GEORGE: She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
GEORGE: She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite.
GEORGE: She doesn't want to get a bra.
GEORGE: She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
GEORGE: She doesn't.
GEORGE: She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her performances.
GEORGE: She got that from you!
GEORGE: She had a dude?
GEORGE: She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
GEORGE: She had this throaty, sexy kind of whisper.
GEORGE: She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
GEORGE: She happens to be very good friends with her.
GEORGE: She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
GEORGE: She hasnt eaten in two days.
GEORGE: She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
GEORGE: She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
GEORGE: She is a good waitress.
GEORGE: She is succinct.
GEORGE: She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
GEORGE: She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
GEORGE: She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
GEORGE: She knows there is nothing to talk about.
GEORGE: She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
GEORGE: She might be leaving to work any minute.
GEORGE: She might not be comfortable.
GEORGE: She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
GEORGE: She must have seen me eating it on TV.
GEORGE: She must have slipped it in here.
GEORGE: She never came back from lunch.
GEORGE: She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
GEORGE: She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
GEORGE: She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
GEORGE: She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
GEORGE: She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
GEORGE: She said looks aren't important to her?
GEORGE: She said no.
GEORGE: She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
GEORGE: She said sweep together you idiots, not sleep together.
GEORGE: She said that?
GEORGE: She says she has to come to New York on business...
GEORGE: She says we cant go out anymore.
GEORGE: she says, We have to talk.
GEORGE: She seems like an it.
GEORGE: She stayed over?
GEORGE: She stole twenty dollars from me. Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
GEORGE: She supports her whole family.
GEORGE: She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't nice.
GEORGE: She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.
GEORGE: She told me she wants-- She told me she wants me to make love to her.
GEORGE: She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
GEORGE: She told you she doesn't like me!
GEORGE: She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
GEORGE: She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
GEORGE: She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
GEORGE: She wants me to take an IQ test.
GEORGE: She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
GEORGE: She wants to talk to you.
GEORGE: She was a delicate flower.
GEORGE: She wasn't flirting with you.
GEORGE: She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
GEORGE: She works for NBC.
GEORGE: She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
GEORGE: She'll open!
GEORGE: She'll Twirl.
GEORGE: She's a virgin?
GEORGE: She's ahem....gone
GEORGE: She's bald.
GEORGE: She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. Talking...
GEORGE: She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
GEORGE: She's got everything, right? She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
GEORGE: She's in traction.
GEORGE: She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
GEORGE: She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
GEORGE: She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
GEORGE: She's not faking!
GEORGE: She's not gonna like it.
GEORGE: She's not out there!
GEORGE: She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
GEORGE: She's off.
GEORGE: She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
GEORGE: She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
GEORGE: She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
GEORGE: She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
GEORGE: She's still doing that?
GEORGE: she's there, I can hear her
GEORGE: She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
GEORGE: She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
GEORGE: She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.
GEORGE: She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months.
GEORGE: SHEILA!!! WO
GEORGE: Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
GEORGE: Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
GEORGE: Shes right above you?
GEORGE: Shh! This is it!
GEORGE: Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
GEORGE: Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. Sweetheart.. No, no, no. That ought to cover it. Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... Come on, come on, come on...
GEORGE: Shocked?
GEORGE: Shoplifting.
GEORGE: Shortness of breath..
GEORGE: Should be a while though.
GEORGE: Should I apologize to Woody?
GEORGE: Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
GEORGE: Should I leave this..?
GEORGE: Should I not go on this trip?
GEORGE: Should I take some?
GEORGE: Should we be talkin' about this?
GEORGE: Should we tell him we're leaving?
GEORGE: Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
GEORGE: Shst, You should take the test for me.
GEORGE: Shut up!
GEORGE: Shut up!
GEORGE: Shut up! Shut up!
GEORGE: SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...
GEORGE: Shut up?
GEORGE: Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
GEORGE: Si, por favor.
GEORGE: Si, si.
GEORGE: Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?
GEORGE: Sid, it's completely his fault.
GEORGE: Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
GEORGE: Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
GEORGE: Siena, I love you.
GEORGE: Signal? What signal?
GEORGE: Silence YES!!
GEORGE: Simmer!
GEORGE: Simple joke from a simple man.
GEORGE: Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
GEORGE: Singapore?! Do you hear this?
GEORGE: Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
GEORGE: Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
GEORGE: Sir?
GEORGE: Sir?
GEORGE: Sit down. Join us, please.
GEORGE: Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.

GEORGE: Smile
GEORGE: Smile.
GEORGE: Smoking.
GEORGE: Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
GEORGE: So ... uh, squirrel.
GEORGE: So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
GEORGE: So am I!
GEORGE: So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out, they're Paula's.
GEORGE: So are they coming tonight or not?
GEORGE: So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
GEORGE: So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
GEORGE: So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
GEORGE: So countries just exchange gifts like that?
GEORGE: So Dad,--
GEORGE: So did you enjoy your lunch?
GEORGE: So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
GEORGE: So dont finish it.
GEORGE: So eh, what do you say?
GEORGE: So fast? What about me?
GEORGE: So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!

GEORGE: So how long did you live there?
GEORGE: So how long has it been in the basement?
GEORGE: So how was it?
GEORGE: So how were the eggs?
GEORGE: So I finally stop and say, Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left.
GEORGE: So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this low cut thing. So I said to her: Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?
GEORGE: So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
GEORGE: So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
GEORGE: So I said, Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ...  He doesn't move. So I said uh, Can't stand ya', Can't stand ya' He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library, a grown man, getting a wedgie.
GEORGE: So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
GEORGE: So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
GEORGE: So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
GEORGE: So I spoke to the security guard.
GEORGE: So I still haven't heard about that job.
GEORGE: So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
GEORGE: So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
GEORGE: So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
GEORGE: So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
GEORGE: So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
GEORGE: So it was a good experience.
GEORGE: So it was my comment that broke them up?
GEORGE: So it's just mono.
GEORGE: So just kick her out.

I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
GEORGE: So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
GEORGE: So long, Mr. Farkus.
GEORGE: So now you're doing my bits?
GEORGE: So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
GEORGE: So Scott's your roommate, huh?
GEORGE: So she coughed.
GEORGE: So she doesn't like me?
GEORGE: So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
GEORGE: So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh...
GEORGE: So she's gorgeous.
GEORGE: So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
GEORGE: So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
GEORGE: So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
GEORGE: So then he makes his own bed?
GEORGE: So then what?
GEORGE: So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
GEORGE: So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
GEORGE: So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
GEORGE: So uh where are the clothes?
GEORGE: So uh... been to a bris before?
GEORGE: So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?
GEORGE: So we had a good time... the four of us.
GEORGE: So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
GEORGE: So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
GEORGE: So we pick up some
GEORGE: So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
GEORGE: So we'll do it tomorrow.
GEORGE: So we're not going?
GEORGE: So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
GEORGE: So what did she say?
GEORGE: So what do you care what she thinks.
GEORGE: So what do you care?
GEORGE: So what do you do?
GEORGE: So what do you want me to do?
GEORGE: So what happened?
GEORGE: So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
GEORGE: So what have you been doing with yourself?
GEORGE: So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
GEORGE: So what're you gonna do?
GEORGE: So what's in it for the mentor?
GEORGE: So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
GEORGE: So what's your point?
GEORGE: So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
GEORGE: So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
GEORGE: So what, what is so bad about that?
GEORGE: So what?
GEORGE: So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
GEORGE: So what? So what if I do?
GEORGE: So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
GEORGE: So what? Thats good.
GEORGE: So what? What am I supposed to do?
GEORGE: So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
GEORGE: So when're you gonna see her?
GEORGE: So where are you staying?
GEORGE: So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
GEORGE: So why didn't you tell me?
GEORGE: So you can't duplicate 'em.
GEORGE: So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
GEORGE: So you didn't turn her in?
GEORGE: So you don't speak *any* English at all?
GEORGE: So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
GEORGE: So you feel okay?
GEORGE: So you got a $25, 000 a year raise.
GEORGE: So you lied to her?
GEORGE: So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
GEORGE: So you slept with her?
GEORGE: So you think she likes me?
GEORGE: So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
GEORGE: So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
GEORGE: So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
GEORGE: So you're against me now?
GEORGE: So you're buying the car back for your parents?
GEORGE: So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?

GEORGE: So, anything to uh, nosh?
GEORGE: So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
GEORGE: So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
GEORGE: So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
GEORGE: So, check out my view.
GEORGE: So, Dad...
GEORGE: So, details?
GEORGE: So, did you get your new plates?
GEORGE: So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
GEORGE: So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
GEORGE: So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
GEORGE: So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
GEORGE: So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
GEORGE: So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
GEORGE: So, how was the movie?
GEORGE: So, how was the trip?
GEORGE: So, I am have to going to break up with you.
GEORGE: So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
GEORGE: So, I could do that?
GEORGE: So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
GEORGE: So, I ran into the Rosses again.
GEORGE: So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
GEORGE: So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
GEORGE: So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.

GEORGE: So, Jerry and Nina, huh?
GEORGE: So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
GEORGE: So, Lena was upset, huh?
GEORGE: So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
GEORGE: So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
GEORGE: So, maybe this should be it.
GEORGE: So, much longer?
GEORGE: So, she cant get the apartment.
GEORGE: So, she doesnt move in.
GEORGE: So, she fell, and then she started screaming, My back! My back! So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
GEORGE: So, she was switching? Back and forth?
GEORGE: So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
GEORGE: So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine.

GEORGE: Take the suit.
GEORGE: Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
GEORGE: Talk to him!

GEORGE: Thanks. Thanks a lot.
GEORGE: Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
GEORGE: Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
GEORGE: That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
GEORGE: That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
GEORGE: That guy is not blind.
GEORGE: That I'm used to.
GEORGE: That is an opening.
GEORGE: That is really nice.
GEORGE: That is so funny!
GEORGE: That is what I want.
GEORGE: That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
GEORGE: That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
GEORGE: That should be 14, let me just...
GEORGE: That took awhile.
GEORGE: That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
GEORGE: That was an honest mistake.
GEORGE: That was different!
GEORGE: That was no good?
GEORGE: That was very real.
GEORGE: That wasn't a laser pen.
GEORGE: That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
GEORGE: That won't be necessary.
GEORGE: That'd be me.
GEORGE: That'll do.
GEORGE: That's a good score.
GEORGE: That's a great idea!!!
GEORGE: That's a little steep don't you think?
GEORGE: That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
GEORGE: That's a myth.
GEORGE: That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
GEORGE: That's a shame.
GEORGE: That's a shame.
GEORGE: That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
GEORGE: That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
GEORGE: That's all I could find. Would you mind getting the door?
GEORGE: That's all?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
GEORGE: That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
GEORGE: That's amazing.
GEORGE: That's an interesting question.
GEORGE: That's because it's underwater.
GEORGE: That's cute.
GEORGE: That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back.
GEORGE: That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
GEORGE: That's exactly my point.
GEORGE: That's exactly what I said, except I used the word momentum.
GEORGE: That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!
GEORGE: That's funny. You're a funny guy.
GEORGE: That's good, we'll give it a try...
GEORGE: That's got nothing to do with it.
GEORGE: That's gotta hurt!
GEORGE: That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
GEORGE: That's it.
GEORGE: That's it. That's the line... ...that destroyed my life.
GEORGE: That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! I quit!
GEORGE: That's it?
GEORGE: That's it?
GEORGE: That's it?
GEORGE: That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
GEORGE: That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
GEORGE: That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
GEORGE: That's my vow to you.
GEORGE: That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
GEORGE: That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book?
GEORGE: That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
GEORGE: That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
GEORGE: That's not Irish.
GEORGE: That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
GEORGE: That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
GEORGE: That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
GEORGE: That's pretty long.
GEORGE: That's pretty paranoid.
GEORGE: That's pretty pathetic.
GEORGE: That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
GEORGE: That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
GEORGE: That's right, no discount!
GEORGE: That's right, of the New York Yankees.
GEORGE: That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!
GEORGE: That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
GEORGE: That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
GEORGE: That's right.
GEORGE: That's right.
GEORGE: That's right.
GEORGE: That's right.
GEORGE: That's right.
GEORGE: That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
GEORGE: That's right. I'm two in the hole!
GEORGE: That's right. It's just me and her.
GEORGE: That's right. You ready?
GEORGE: That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
GEORGE: That's the question, Jimmy.
GEORGE: That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
GEORGE: That's true, that always happens to me.
GEORGE: That's true.
GEORGE: That's uh, for the two of us.
GEORGE: That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
GEORGE: That's unbelievable!
GEORGE: That's unbelievable.
GEORGE: That's very dirty. That's absolutely filthy.
GEORGE: That's what I wanna know.
GEORGE: That's what I want.
GEORGE: That's what I'd like to know.
GEORGE: That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
GEORGE: That's what I'm saying.
GEORGE: That's what I'm trying to find out.
GEORGE: That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
GEORGE: That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
GEORGE: That's what they tell me!
GEORGE: That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
GEORGE: That's where the electricity comes out.
GEORGE: That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
GEORGE: That's why I hate it.
GEORGE: That's why I peeked.
GEORGE: That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
GEORGE: That's why they gave you the apartment?
GEORGE: That's why we're here in America.
GEORGE: That's your boyfriend.
GEORGE: That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
GEORGE: That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
GEORGE: That, or Whos bra is this?
GEORGE: That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
GEORGE: That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
GEORGE: Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
GEORGE: Thats beautiful.
GEORGE: Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
GEORGE: Thats funny. Youre a funny guy.
GEORGE: Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
GEORGE: Thats it.
GEORGE: Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
GEORGE: Thats so brutal, I hate that.
GEORGE: Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
GEORGE: The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
GEORGE: The actress.
GEORGE: The actress?
GEORGE: The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.

GEORGE: The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
GEORGE: The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
GEORGE: The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
GEORGE: The Friars Club?
GEORGE: The Frogger is here.
GEORGE: The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
GEORGE: The guy never came back.
GEORGE: The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
GEORGE: The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.

GEORGE: The network executive. You think she liked me?
GEORGE: The New York Yankees!
GEORGE: The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, oh.
GEORGE: The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
GEORGE: The nice one that works in my office.
GEORGE: The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
GEORGE: The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! Dammit!
GEORGE: The old man got to me.
GEORGE: The one who always sits by herself?
GEORGE: The one with the long sideburns?
GEORGE: The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
GEORGE: The Outlaw of Josey Whales!

GEORGE: Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
GEORGE: Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
GEORGE: Then I got off the phone right away.
GEORGE: Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.

And this tape recorder.
GEORGE: There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
GEORGE: There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.

GEORGE: There's nothing to talk about.
GEORGE: There's porn.
GEORGE: There's something I have to tell you.

GEORGE: They are made from lycra-spandex.
GEORGE: They are?
GEORGE: They are?
GEORGE: They are?... Elaine?
GEORGE: They asked you to do career day?
GEORGE: They can...
GEORGE: They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
GEORGE: They could've at least tried!
GEORGE: They did?
GEORGE: They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
GEORGE: They don't want to see me anymore!
GEORGE: They gave me the Pensky file.
GEORGE: They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.

GEORGE: They had plans, They had plans!
GEORGE: They have no friends.
GEORGE: They haven't said anything to you, have they?
GEORGE: They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
GEORGE: They never try anything.
GEORGE: They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.

GEORGE: They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
GEORGE: They talk back. They go, Hey George, how's it going? I say, Get the hell out of here!

GEORGE: They were right outside!
GEORGE: They were, it's kinda complicated.
GEORGE: They will get a good home won't they?
GEORGE: They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
GEORGE: They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me.
GEORGE: They'll call back.
GEORGE: They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?

It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.

GEORGE: We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
GEORGE: We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
GEORGE: We came in over there!
GEORGE: We cant just let him get away with this.
GEORGE: We could be zipping all over the place.
GEORGE: We could build a cabin like that.
GEORGE: We could.
GEORGE: We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
GEORGE: We did?
GEORGE: We discussed toilet paper.
GEORGE: We do?
GEORGE: We get to go to the opera together!
GEORGE: We go into NBC.
GEORGE: We got a chocolate malt in here!

GEORGE: We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
GEORGE: We got work to do. What about the meeting?
GEORGE: We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
GEORGE: We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
GEORGE: We had sex.
GEORGE: We hardly read anything!
GEORGE: We have a, three-o'clock appointments.
GEORGE: We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.

GEORGE: We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you, thank you.
GEORGE: We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
GEORGE: We'd have to kill him.

GEORGE: We're not dead.
GEORGE: We're not stealing it.
GEORGE: We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
GEORGE: We're out of Bosco!
GEORGE: We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
GEORGE: We're slowing down. Are those the people?
GEORGE: We're straightening out!
GEORGE: We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
GEORGE: We, uh, we go on foot from here.
GEORGE: We...must never ever speak of this again..
GEORGE: Wednesday? That's your personal business?! Skiing?! So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
GEORGE: Welcome back.
GEORGE: Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
GEORGE: Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
GEORGE: Well actually I'm...
GEORGE: Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
GEORGE: Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
GEORGE: Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
GEORGE: Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
GEORGE: Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
GEORGE: Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball.
GEORGE: Well do you want me to take it off?
GEORGE: Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
GEORGE: Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
GEORGE: Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
GEORGE: Well George . . . .
GEORGE: Well get it back! It's very important.
GEORGE: Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
GEORGE: Well have you got a picture?
GEORGE: Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
GEORGE: Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
GEORGE: Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
GEORGE: well humm.. lets get some coffee.
GEORGE: Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
GEORGE: Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
GEORGE: Well I can't break up with her now.
GEORGE: Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
GEORGE: Well I can't stop now... I'm addicted...
GEORGE: Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
GEORGE: Well I didnt do it for my mother.
GEORGE: Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
GEORGE: well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
GEORGE: Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
GEORGE: Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
GEORGE: Well I gotta go talk to Beth.
GEORGE: Well I gotta undo what I did.
GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
GEORGE: Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
GEORGE: Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
GEORGE: Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
GEORGE: Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
GEORGE: Well I know how to drive.
GEORGE: Well I like Dylan.
GEORGE: Well I spoke to Elaine...
GEORGE: Well I still think it was wrong.
GEORGE: Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
GEORGE: Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
GEORGE: Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
GEORGE: Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
GEORGE: Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
GEORGE: Well I would eat you.
GEORGE: Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
GEORGE: Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
GEORGE: Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
GEORGE: Well I've done that.
GEORGE: Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
GEORGE: Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Ménage à Trois?
GEORGE: Well I-I...
GEORGE: Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
GEORGE: Well if she can't tell six from sex then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
GEORGE: Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
GEORGE: Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
GEORGE: Well it was a helluva yada yada.
GEORGE: Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
GEORGE: Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
GEORGE: Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
GEORGE: Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
GEORGE: Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
GEORGE: Well it's over. It's definitely over.
GEORGE: Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
GEORGE: Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
GEORGE: Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
GEORGE: Well let me hear....
GEORGE: Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out Thanks for coming in.
GEORGE: Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps I-I'll reimburse you of course.
GEORGE: Well nothing. I didn't actually say that.
GEORGE: Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
GEORGE: Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
GEORGE: Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
GEORGE: Well played.
GEORGE: Well seems it's about time for George's lunch.
GEORGE: Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
GEORGE: Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
GEORGE: Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
GEORGE: Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
GEORGE: Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
GEORGE: Well that's the gist of it!
GEORGE: Well the guy's just standing there.
GEORGE: Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
GEORGE: Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
GEORGE: Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
GEORGE: Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
GEORGE: Well they're hard to load.
GEORGE: Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
GEORGE: Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
GEORGE: Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
GEORGE: Well today's your lucky day.
GEORGE: Well uh....
GEORGE: Well um, what about tomorrow night?
GEORGE: Well was it a woman?
GEORGE: Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know, maybe you took them with you.
GEORGE: Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
GEORGE: Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
GEORGE: Well what do you eat?
GEORGE: Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
GEORGE: Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?!
GEORGE: Well what would be the point of that?
GEORGE: Well what would I say in the note?
GEORGE: Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
GEORGE: Well whad you buy it for?
GEORGE: Well where is she?
GEORGE: Well who doesn't.
GEORGE: Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
GEORGE: Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
GEORGE: Well why didn't we?
GEORGE: Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
GEORGE: Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
GEORGE: Well why'd she do that?
GEORGE: Well you didn't have to say it like that.
GEORGE: Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
GEORGE: Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
GEORGE: Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
GEORGE: Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
GEORGE: Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
GEORGE: Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
GEORGE: Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
GEORGE: Well you should have been O'Brien.
GEORGE: Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
GEORGE: Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
GEORGE: Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
GEORGE: Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
GEORGE: Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
GEORGE: Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
GEORGE: Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
GEORGE: Well, aren't you something?
GEORGE: Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
GEORGE: Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry...
GEORGE: Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
GEORGE: Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
GEORGE: Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
GEORGE: Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
GEORGE: Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
GEORGE: Well, Danielle, we should get going. I got a key made for you.
GEORGE: Well, did you see it?
GEORGE: Well, didn't he regift the label maker?
GEORGE: Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
GEORGE: Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
GEORGE: Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
GEORGE: Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
GEORGE: Well, giddy-up!
GEORGE: Well, go ahead! Do it!
GEORGE: Well, go ahead, tell him.
GEORGE: Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
GEORGE: Well, he does.
GEORGE: Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
GEORGE: Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
GEORGE: Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
GEORGE: Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
GEORGE: Well, he's merry.
GEORGE: Well, here we are.
GEORGE: Well, here you go. What do you think?
GEORGE: Well, how about that?
GEORGE: Well, how did she react?
GEORGE: Well, how good a look did you get?
GEORGE: Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here.
GEORGE: Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
GEORGE: Well, I am not going.
GEORGE: Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
GEORGE: Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
GEORGE: Well, I can't crack this one.
GEORGE: Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. What are you doing?
GEORGE: Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
GEORGE: Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
GEORGE: Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
GEORGE: Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
GEORGE: Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
GEORGE: Well, I didn't want to break our date.
GEORGE: Well, I do what I can.
GEORGE: Well, I don't really like her.
GEORGE: Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
GEORGE: Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
GEORGE: Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
GEORGE: Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
GEORGE: Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
GEORGE: Well, I gotta do somethin'.
GEORGE: Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
GEORGE: Well, I guess I'm getting older.
GEORGE: Well, I guess these would be out of the question.
GEORGE: Well, I have to see her.
GEORGE: Well, I heard a noise.
GEORGE: Well, I join them in their grief.
GEORGE: Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
GEORGE: Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
GEORGE: Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
GEORGE: Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
GEORGE: Well, I might be getting into that.
GEORGE: Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
GEORGE: Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
GEORGE: Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
GEORGE: Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
GEORGE: Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
GEORGE: Well, I think this is it.
GEORGE: Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
GEORGE: Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
GEORGE: Well, I think you're wrong about that. And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
GEORGE: Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
GEORGE: Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. Mom's coming to get you.
GEORGE: Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
GEORGE: Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
GEORGE: Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres.
GEORGE: Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
GEORGE: Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
GEORGE: Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
GEORGE: Well, I was wondering...
GEORGE: Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
GEORGE: Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that, again.
GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift.
GEORGE: Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
GEORGE: Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
GEORGE: Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
GEORGE: Well, I'm here. What is it?
GEORGE: Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
GEORGE: Well, I'm mentioning his name.
GEORGE: Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
GEORGE: Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
GEORGE: Well, I'm sorry!
GEORGE: Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way.
GEORGE: Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
GEORGE: Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
GEORGE: Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
GEORGE: Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
GEORGE: Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
GEORGE: Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
GEORGE: Well, I'm, I'm just looking.
GEORGE: Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
GEORGE: Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
GEORGE: Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
GEORGE: Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
GEORGE: Well, I-I just recently uh...
GEORGE: Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
GEORGE: Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
GEORGE: Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
GEORGE: Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay.
GEORGE: Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
GEORGE: Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
GEORGE: Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
GEORGE: Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancée, Susan. May she rest in peace.
GEORGE: Well, is he good, Kramer?
GEORGE: Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
GEORGE: Well, it comes and goes.
GEORGE: Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
GEORGE: Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
GEORGE: Well, it happened again.
GEORGE: Well, it was a hell of a ride.
GEORGE: Well, it was slightly used...
GEORGE: Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. All right you have everything?
GEORGE: Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
GEORGE: Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
GEORGE: Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
GEORGE: Well, it's . . . much too low.
GEORGE: Well, it's a funny idea.
GEORGE: Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken.
GEORGE: Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
GEORGE: Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.
GEORGE: Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
GEORGE: Well, it's all over. I slipped up.
GEORGE: Well, it's definetly him.
GEORGE: Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
GEORGE: Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
GEORGE: Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
GEORGE: Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
GEORGE: Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
GEORGE: Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
GEORGE: Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
GEORGE: Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
GEORGE: Well, it's true. I saw it.
GEORGE: Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
GEORGE: Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
GEORGE: Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
GEORGE: Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
GEORGE: Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
GEORGE: Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
GEORGE: Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
GEORGE: Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh!
GEORGE: Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. So you two uh, shop at the same store, ?
GEORGE: Well, lets just leave.
GEORGE: Well, live and learn.
GEORGE: Well, look at this. This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
GEORGE: Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
GEORGE: Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
GEORGE: Well, maybe not married, but...
GEORGE: Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
GEORGE: Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
GEORGE: Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
GEORGE: Well, maybe you could show me something else.
GEORGE: Well, me neither.
GEORGE: Well, my bed is too small.
GEORGE: Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
GEORGE: Well, my mother, Jerry..
GEORGE: Well, no.
GEORGE: Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
GEORGE: Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
GEORGE: Well, not yet.. Fiancé.
GEORGE: Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there. Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.
GEORGE: Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
GEORGE: Well, okay.
GEORGE: Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this That's the biggest.
GEORGE: Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
GEORGE: Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
GEORGE: Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
GEORGE: Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, La Cocina. ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
GEORGE: Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
GEORGE: Well, scintillating as always.
GEORGE: Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
GEORGE: Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
GEORGE: Well, she probably just assumed.
GEORGE: Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
GEORGE: Well, should I call you later?
GEORGE: Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
GEORGE: Well, so much for purification week.
GEORGE: Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
GEORGE: Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
GEORGE: Well, some women like it.
GEORGE: Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
GEORGE: Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
GEORGE: Well, Steven, I, uh..
GEORGE: Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
GEORGE: Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
GEORGE: Well, thank you for your support.
GEORGE: Well, thank you.
GEORGE: Well, that doesn't mean anything!
GEORGE: Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
GEORGE: Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
GEORGE: Well, that was bound to happen.
GEORGE: Well, that's a given.
GEORGE: Well, that's not offensive. It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
GEORGE: Well, that's really not fair.
GEORGE: Well, that's the name!
GEORGE: Well, that's.. Elaine!
GEORGE: Well, thats flattering.
GEORGE: Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
GEORGE: Well, there could be.
GEORGE: Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
GEORGE: Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
GEORGE: Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
GEORGE: Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
GEORGE: Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
GEORGE: Well, they were in a rush.
GEORGE: Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
GEORGE: Well, they're obviously not here.
GEORGE: Well, this I take to the grave.
GEORGE: Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
GEORGE: Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
GEORGE: Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
GEORGE: Well, uh, are there any other options?
GEORGE: Well, uh... come in, come, come in.
GEORGE: Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
GEORGE: Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.
GEORGE: Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
GEORGE: Well, was it for Costanza or...
GEORGE: Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
GEORGE: Well, we really should be-
GEORGE: Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
GEORGE: Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.

GEORGE: Well, what should I do, Kramer?
GEORGE: Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
GEORGE: Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
GEORGE: Well, what's the reason?
GEORGE: Well, who is she?
GEORGE: Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
GEORGE: Well, why didn't they ask me?

GEORGE: Well, you could move in with my parents.
GEORGE: Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
GEORGE: Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is: You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
GEORGE: Well, you gotta do it.

GEORGE: Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
GEORGE: Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
GEORGE: Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
GEORGE: Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
GEORGE: Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
GEORGE: Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
GEORGE: Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
GEORGE: Well, you know. It's understandable.
GEORGE: Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.

GEORGE: Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
GEORGE: Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this.
GEORGE: Well, you should always consider podiatry. There's nothing wrong with the feet.
GEORGE: Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
GEORGE: Well, You're not gonna believe it...
GEORGE: Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.
GEORGE: Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.

I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke.

GEORGE: Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.
GEORGE: Why? What do you mean?
GEORGE: Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
GEORGE: Why? Why is my code so important?
GEORGE: Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
GEORGE: Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.

GEORGE: Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
GEORGE: Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
GEORGE: Would they tune in?
GEORGE: Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, What do you do? and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
GEORGE: Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
GEORGE: Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.

GEORGE: Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
GEORGE: Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.

GEORGE: Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh...boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!
GEORGE: Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes, how do I get the rest of the clothes?
GEORGE: Yeah! Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
GEORGE: Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
GEORGE: Yeah, 5A!
GEORGE: Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
GEORGE: Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
GEORGE: Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
GEORGE: Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
GEORGE: Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
GEORGE: Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
GEORGE: Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
GEORGE: Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
GEORGE: Yeah, Art Vandelay.
GEORGE: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
GEORGE: yeah, burned. Whoo..
GEORGE: Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
GEORGE: Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
GEORGE: Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
GEORGE: Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
GEORGE: Yeah, but you know where it is.
GEORGE: Yeah, come on.
GEORGE: Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
GEORGE: Yeah, coy.
GEORGE: Yeah, Cubans.
GEORGE: Yeah, Definite smoke.
GEORGE: Yeah, dentist of the stars.
GEORGE: Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? I better take this. I hate the little room. Oh, hello, Doctor.
GEORGE: Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.
GEORGE: Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
GEORGE: Yeah, duty. Do you know how much duty is?
GEORGE: Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
GEORGE: Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
GEORGE: Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
GEORGE: Yeah, go ahead, call.
GEORGE: Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
GEORGE: Yeah, good night.
GEORGE: Yeah, good, good.
GEORGE: Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
GEORGE: Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah, he did.
GEORGE: Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
GEORGE: Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
GEORGE: Yeah, he's right.
GEORGE: Yeah, he's something, isn't he?
GEORGE: Yeah, here you go.
GEORGE: Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
GEORGE: Yeah, hell have my parents.
GEORGE: Yeah, him.
GEORGE: Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
GEORGE: Yeah, how did you know that?
GEORGE: Yeah, huh.
GEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
GEORGE: Yeah, I better grab some too.
GEORGE: Yeah, I didn't mean that.
GEORGE: Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
GEORGE: Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
GEORGE: Yeah, I got one too.
GEORGE: Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
GEORGE: Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
GEORGE: Yeah, I know that. Could you start, working?
GEORGE: Yeah, I know what happened.
GEORGE: Yeah, I may move out there. I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
GEORGE: Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
GEORGE: Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
GEORGE: Yeah, I saw it.
GEORGE: Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
GEORGE: Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.
GEORGE: Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
GEORGE: Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
GEORGE: Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
GEORGE: Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
GEORGE: Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
GEORGE: Yeah, I turned him down.
GEORGE: Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
GEORGE: Yeah, I wish.
GEORGE: Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'll zip in, How do you do?, zip out. She'll love me.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm fine.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm sorry.
GEORGE: Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
GEORGE: Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
GEORGE: Yeah, it is.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
GEORGE: Yeah, it's bizarre.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's her uncle's.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh, After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
GEORGE: Yeah, it's the last one.
GEORGE: Yeah, its George.
GEORGE: Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
GEORGE: Yeah, just like I do.
GEORGE: Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
GEORGE: yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
GEORGE: Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
GEORGE: Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
GEORGE: Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
GEORGE: Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks.
GEORGE: Yeah, like that.
GEORGE: Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
GEORGE: Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59, 000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
GEORGE: Yeah, maybe. Where'd you get that?
GEORGE: Yeah, me either.
GEORGE: Yeah, me too.
GEORGE: Yeah, me too...
GEORGE: Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
GEORGE: Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
GEORGE: Yeah, my roommate in college.
GEORGE: Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
GEORGE: Yeah, no pop-in, no in the neighborhood, no I saw your light was on. And the best part is, if things go really well...
GEORGE: Yeah, now I gotcha!
GEORGE: Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
GEORGE: Yeah, okay.
GEORGE: Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
GEORGE: Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
GEORGE: Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
GEORGE: Yeah, phew.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
GEORGE: Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine? JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
GEORGE: Yeah, same time. There you go.
GEORGE: Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
GEORGE: Yeah, she's a B.L.
GEORGE: Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
GEORGE: Yeah, she's quite a character.
GEORGE: Yeah, she's very lovely.
GEORGE: Yeah, six weeks.
GEORGE: Yeah, so what?
GEORGE: Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one!
GEORGE: Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
GEORGE: Yeah, so?
GEORGE: Yeah, Sure, sure,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
GEORGE: Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
GEORGE: Yeah, sure.
GEORGE: Yeah, sure.
GEORGE: Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this?
GEORGE: Yeah, sure. Then my father will have no place to sleep. He's gotta move out.
GEORGE: Yeah, Susan said you'd be excited.
GEORGE: Yeah, Susan tell him.
GEORGE: Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.
GEORGE: Yeah, take it easy.
GEORGE: Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
GEORGE: Yeah, thanks.
GEORGE: Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
GEORGE: Yeah, that was enough.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's right.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's right.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's right. It's working.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
GEORGE: Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
GEORGE: Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
GEORGE: Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
GEORGE: Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
GEORGE: Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
GEORGE: Yeah, the pilot!
GEORGE: Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
GEORGE: Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
GEORGE: Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
GEORGE: Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
GEORGE: Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
GEORGE: Yeah, they're not better than me.
GEORGE: Yeah, this is my first time here.
GEORGE: yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
GEORGE: Yeah, too bad. Too bad.
GEORGE: Yeah, two for the 7:15 of Novaj pravas . What you're wearing the green sweater?
GEORGE: Yeah, uh, no menus.
GEORGE: Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
GEORGE: Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
GEORGE: Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
GEORGE: Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
GEORGE: Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
GEORGE: Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
GEORGE: Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
GEORGE: Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
GEORGE: Yeah, well, they're my socks!
GEORGE: Yeah, well.
GEORGE: Yeah, well....
GEORGE: Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. But you, my friend, may be in luck.
GEORGE: Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
GEORGE: Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
GEORGE: Yeah, what the hell.
GEORGE: Yeah, what the hell?!
GEORGE: Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
GEORGE: Yeah, why? Why?
GEORGE: Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.
GEORGE: Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, right here.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, she's here.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan!
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta do it classy
GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish.
GEORGE: Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
GEORGE: Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
GEORGE: Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
GEORGE: Yeah, you said it. Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
GEORGE: Yeah, you show us the 900.
GEORGE: Yeah, you're just so... hip.
GEORGE: Yeah, you're right, you're right. Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
GEORGE: Yeah, your milk.
GEORGE: Yeah-hah!
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah. ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
GEORGE: Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
GEORGE: Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
GEORGE: Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
GEORGE: Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.
GEORGE: Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
GEORGE: Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
GEORGE: Yeah. Did you do it?
GEORGE: Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
GEORGE: Yeah. Good weekend.
GEORGE: Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
GEORGE: Yeah. HELLO!!!
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey! Hey!
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
GEORGE: Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
GEORGE: Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
GEORGE: Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
GEORGE: Yeah. I can't get over it.
GEORGE: Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. Can I borrow your menu?
GEORGE: Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
GEORGE: Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
GEORGE: Yeah. I had a great time.
GEORGE: Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
GEORGE: Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
GEORGE: Yeah. I think we really go something here.
GEORGE: Yeah. I'll pay for it.
GEORGE: Yeah. I'll see you later.
GEORGE: Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.
GEORGE: Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
GEORGE: Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
GEORGE: Yeah. Just confirming.
GEORGE: Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
GEORGE: Yeah. Kramer...
GEORGE: Yeah. Let's go.
GEORGE: Yeah. Me too.
GEORGE: Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
GEORGE: Yeah. No problem.
GEORGE: Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea.
GEORGE: Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, Can we change the subject?
GEORGE: Yeah. Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
GEORGE: Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
GEORGE: Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
GEORGE: Yeah. Really.
GEORGE: Yeah. Right.
GEORGE: Yeah. See ya.
GEORGE: Yeah. see you later.
GEORGE: Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
GEORGE: Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?
GEORGE: Yeah. Sit down there. Hello, Jerry. I believe you know Nina.
GEORGE: Yeah. So how does that help me?
GEORGE: Yeah. So what happened?
GEORGE: Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
GEORGE: Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?
GEORGE: Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
GEORGE: Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
GEORGE: Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
GEORGE: Yeah. The *original*.
GEORGE: Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
GEORGE: Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, You know you're a quite a character.
GEORGE: yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses.
GEORGE: Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
GEORGE: Yeah. We should do this again.
GEORGE: Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
GEORGE: Yeah. Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
GEORGE: Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.
GEORGE: Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
GEORGE: Yeah. What time is it?
GEORGE: Yeah. What's that?
GEORGE: Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
GEORGE: Yeah. Why, what do you do?
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah, one second.
GEORGE: Yeah. yeah. I-I know.
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
GEORGE: Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
GEORGE: Yeah. You could base a character on me.
GEORGE: Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
GEORGE: Yeah. You like it.
GEORGE: Yeah. You've heard of it?
GEORGE: Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
GEORGE: Yeah.. Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
GEORGE: Yeah.. television.
GEORGE: yeah.. Thank you.
GEORGE: yeah.. the ambulance got there very quickly
GEORGE: Yeah.. They made me sick.
GEORGE: Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
GEORGE: Yeah...
GEORGE: Yeah...
GEORGE: Yeah... full.
GEORGE: Yeah.....
GEORGE: yeah....euh...I dunno What?
GEORGE: Yeah?
GEORGE: Yeah?
GEORGE: Yeah?
GEORGE: Yeah?

GEORGE: Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
GEORGE: Yeah?...
GEORGE: Yeahaha, I gave it a shot ... So, any word on the artiste?
GEORGE: Yeahhh.
GEORGE: Yearn? Do I yearn?
GEORGE: Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
GEORGE: Yeeeaaah. Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
GEORGE: Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
GEORGE: Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
GEORGE: Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
GEORGE: Yep. That's five!
GEORGE: Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
GEORGE: Yes ... yes, yes
GEORGE: Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
GEORGE: Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
GEORGE: Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
GEORGE: Yes faddah.
GEORGE: Yes funny let's go.
GEORGE: Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
GEORGE: Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
GEORGE: Yes I did.
GEORGE: Yes I do.
GEORGE: Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
GEORGE: Yes I suppose they are.
GEORGE: Yes I suppose they do.
GEORGE: Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... ..... Hello...Hello..
GEORGE: Yes it is! You're very charming!
GEORGE: Yes it is.
GEORGE: Yes it is.
GEORGE: Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
GEORGE: Yes Mr. Hayman.
GEORGE: Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
GEORGE: Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
GEORGE: Yes sir!
GEORGE: Yes sir.
GEORGE: Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
GEORGE: Yes we will.
GEORGE: Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
GEORGE: Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
GEORGE: Yes you did!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes!
GEORGE: Yes! 860, 000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
GEORGE: Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
GEORGE: Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
GEORGE: Yes! How're we gonna do that?
GEORGE: Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
GEORGE: Yes! I see enormous potential here.
GEORGE: Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
GEORGE: YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
GEORGE: Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
GEORGE: Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
GEORGE: Yes! Yes, all right--anything!
GEORGE: Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!
GEORGE: Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
GEORGE: Yes, a rosy glow.
GEORGE: Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
GEORGE: Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
GEORGE: Yes, as I see it.
GEORGE: Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
GEORGE: Yes, but I am not taking it.
GEORGE: Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
GEORGE: Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
GEORGE: Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
GEORGE: Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
GEORGE: Yes, good for me!
GEORGE: Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
GEORGE: Yes, he's a clown!
GEORGE: Yes, hello. Party's over.
GEORGE: Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
GEORGE: Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
GEORGE: Yes, I am.
GEORGE: Yes, I am.
GEORGE: Yes, I have a problem with paba.
GEORGE: Yes, I heard you!
GEORGE: Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
GEORGE: Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
GEORGE: Yes, I mentioned your name.
GEORGE: Yes, I saw that.
GEORGE: Yes, I sure did.
GEORGE: Yes, I think I would.
GEORGE: Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
GEORGE: Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
GEORGE: Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
GEORGE: Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis.
GEORGE: Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?
GEORGE: Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
GEORGE: Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
GEORGE: Yes, it was very, very good.
GEORGE: Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
GEORGE: Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
GEORGE: Yes, Mr. Hayman
GEORGE: Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
GEORGE: Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
GEORGE: Yes, oh yes very much.
GEORGE: Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
GEORGE: Yes, please.
GEORGE: Yes, please.
GEORGE: Yes, positive.
GEORGE: Yes, she hates cigarettes.
GEORGE: Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
GEORGE: Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
GEORGE: Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
GEORGE: Yes, sir.
GEORGE: Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.
GEORGE: Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
GEORGE: Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
GEORGE: Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
GEORGE: Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
GEORGE: Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
GEORGE: Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving.
GEORGE: Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
GEORGE: Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
GEORGE: Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
GEORGE: Yes, yes I am.
GEORGE: Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
GEORGE: Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
GEORGE: Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
GEORGE: Yes, yes, I am.
GEORGE: Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
GEORGE: Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
GEORGE: Yes, yes,.
GEORGE: Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
GEORGE: Yes, you have to be Murphy.
GEORGE: Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
GEORGE: Yes.
GEORGE: Yes.
GEORGE: Yes.
GEORGE: Yes.

GEORGE: Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
GEORGE: Yes. Changes.
GEORGE: Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
GEORGE: Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
GEORGE: Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. Excuse me.
GEORGE: Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
GEORGE: Yes. Now take off those pants.
GEORGE: Yes. Please. Please, let's go.
GEORGE: Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
GEORGE: Yes. Significant shrinkage.
GEORGE: Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
GEORGE: Yes. The legends are true.
GEORGE: Yes. The New Yorker.
GEORGE: Yes. This is wrong!
GEORGE: Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention...
GEORGE: Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
GEORGE: Yes. Well...
GEORGE: Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?
GEORGE: Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
GEORGE: Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
GEORGE: Yes. Yes.
GEORGE: Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember
GEORGE: Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No r which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. Hebert it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. All right. I

GEORGE: You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.

GEORGE: You didn't say hello?
GEORGE: You didn't tell her.
GEORGE: You didn't?
GEORGE: You didnt say junior.
GEORGE: You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem.
GEORGE: You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
GEORGE: You do it for me.

GEORGE: You don't trust my poker face?
GEORGE: You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
GEORGE: You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
GEORGE: You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
GEORGE: You don't wanna know.
GEORGE: You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
GEORGE: You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman.Neither rain nor sleet nor snow.....It's the first one.
GEORGE: You don't?
GEORGE: You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...

GEORGE: You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
GEORGE: You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
GEORGE: You had to move the mirror?
GEORGE: You have a car?
GEORGE: You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, I love you, and the other says, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat..
GEORGE: You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
GEORGE: You have no idea how refreshing that is.
GEORGE: You have to drink that whole thing?
GEORGE: You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.

GEORGE: You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?
GEORGE: You hurt me.
GEORGE: You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
GEORGE: You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
GEORGE: You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
GEORGE: You just hesitated.
GEORGE: You just said you weren't tucking.
GEORGE: You knew? How did you know?
GEORGE: You know -- Elaine.
GEORGE: You know a hug: definitely good.
GEORGE: You know a lost and found could be a good idea.

GEORGE: You know her name?
GEORGE: You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
GEORGE: You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. Its all mental.

GEORGE: You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
GEORGE: You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
GEORGE: You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
GEORGE: You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
GEORGE: You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.

GEORGE: You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
GEORGE: You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
GEORGE: You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together.

GEORGE: You know we're living in a society!
GEORGE: You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
GEORGE: You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always waaaa, waaaa, you know now it woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
GEORGE: You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
GEORGE: You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
GEORGE: You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.

GEORGE: You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
GEORGE: You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.

GEORGE: You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. I'll just browse around.
GEORGE: You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
GEORGE: You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
GEORGE: You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
GEORGE: You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
GEORGE: You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. I've got to.
GEORGE: You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.

GEORGE: You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. So, what d'you, what d'you think?

GEORGE: You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
GEORGE: You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
GEORGE: You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
GEORGE: You know, I could have actually gone to that.
GEORGE: You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.

Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
GEORGE: You know, I haven't eaten anything.
GEORGE: You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
GEORGE: You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
GEORGE: You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
GEORGE: You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancée, Susan.. In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
GEORGE: You know, I'm a little nervous.
GEORGE: You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
GEORGE: You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
GEORGE: You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
GEORGE: You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
GEORGE: You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
GEORGE: You know, it really can't.
GEORGE: You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
GEORGE: You know, it's a miracle you're not married. Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
GEORGE: You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!
GEORGE: You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
GEORGE: You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
GEORGE: You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
GEORGE: you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
GEORGE: You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
GEORGE: You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
GEORGE: You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor there's really nothing they can do.
GEORGE: You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
GEORGE: You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff.
GEORGE: You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
GEORGE: You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. I'm really hungry.
GEORGE: You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself.
GEORGE: You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
GEORGE: You know, the guy from Cheers.
GEORGE: You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
GEORGE: You know, the time..
GEORGE: You know, the uh...
GEORGE: You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
GEORGE: You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
GEORGE: You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
GEORGE: You know, we absolutely should.
GEORGE: You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
GEORGE: You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
GEORGE: You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
GEORGE: You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
GEORGE: You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
GEORGE: You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
GEORGE: You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
GEORGE: You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. . You know it's like pfffff, all right that's enough, you're through.
GEORGE: You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
GEORGE: You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
GEORGE: You know. I was alone..
GEORGE: You know. You use the, uh...
GEORGE: You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
GEORGE: You like ice?
GEORGE: You like that?
GEORGE: You look like you're five years old.
GEORGE: You mean a blessing in disguise?
GEORGE: You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
GEORGE: You mean alias.
GEORGE: You mean in the end?
GEORGE: You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
GEORGE: You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
GEORGE: You mean like a bra?
GEORGE: You mean one of those vinyl things?
GEORGE: You mean she just laid there topless?
GEORGE: You mean that's true, I'm right?!
GEORGE: You mean, like, a former member?
GEORGE: You mean, uh..?
GEORGE: You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
GEORGE: You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
GEORGE: You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
GEORGE: You miss her, don't you?
GEORGE: You miss her.
GEORGE: You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
GEORGE: You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
GEORGE: You nervous?
GEORGE: You never had sex in the office before?
GEORGE: You never played Vegas.
GEORGE: You never run out, do you? Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
GEORGE: You never should have taken away his keys!
GEORGE: You only think that because you know me.
GEORGE: You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
GEORGE: You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
GEORGE: You owe me ten dollars.
GEORGE: You paid that crook?!
GEORGE: You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
GEORGE: You pick it.
GEORGE: You put a hot tub... in your living room?
GEORGE: you put him on the spot
GEORGE: You really think so?
GEORGE: You really think so?
GEORGE: You really think this looks O.K. on me?
GEORGE: You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
GEORGE: You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
GEORGE: you said step off? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
GEORGE: You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
GEORGE: You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
GEORGE: You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
GEORGE: You saw Jane topless?
GEORGE: You saw who, what?
GEORGE: You schedule a late meeting.
GEORGE: You see . You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen.
GEORGE: You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
GEORGE: You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
GEORGE: You see that woman on the horse?
GEORGE: You see this is the thing. . . . I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together,
GEORGE: You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
GEORGE: You see what just happened here?
GEORGE: You see, hu, ho ho.
GEORGE: You see, It's right here. It's all white...
GEORGE: You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
GEORGE: You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
GEORGE: You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
GEORGE: You see... All right I knew it.
GEORGE: You see.....WHAT!!
GEORGE: You see? Now that is a handsome man. Oh please.
GEORGE: You see? We were made for each other. It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
GEORGE: You see?.. You see?!
GEORGE: You sell them?
GEORGE: You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
GEORGE: You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
GEORGE: You should have lied.
GEORGE: You should have somebody take a look at that.
GEORGE: You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
GEORGE: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
GEORGE: You shouldn't have tucked.
GEORGE: You slept with the groom?!
GEORGE: You spoke to my mother?
GEORGE: You spritz a little Lysol on it.
GEORGE: You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
GEORGE: You still owe me a secret.
GEORGE: You stole the bread?
GEORGE: You sure?
GEORGE: You sure?
GEORGE: You sure?
GEORGE: You talked all about that?
GEORGE: You tell Russell.
GEORGE: You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
GEORGE: You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
GEORGE: You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. Russell?
GEORGE: You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine is better than Pepsi.
GEORGE: You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
GEORGE: You think I'm going down?
GEORGE: You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
GEORGE: You think it's something?
GEORGE: You think Kramer'll do it?
GEORGE: You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
GEORGE: You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
GEORGE: You think she should have said something?
GEORGE: You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
GEORGE: You think she would care about the red dot?
GEORGE: You think she's happy?
GEORGE: You think so?
GEORGE: You think so?
GEORGE: You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
GEORGE: You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
GEORGE: You think you could hook me up with these guys?
GEORGE: You think you could?
GEORGE: You think you're going to the other side with Hi? You're not going to make it.
GEORGE: You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. Is that a coincidence? Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going
GEORGE: You think?
GEORGE: You think?
GEORGE: You think?
GEORGE: You thought she was good looking, right?
GEORGE: You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. Gimme a bite.
GEORGE: You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
GEORGE: You told her? She's not your wife!
GEORGE: You told him? What did you tell him?
GEORGE: You took me to one of your shows..
GEORGE: You uh owe me for the ticket.
GEORGE: You vomited in 1987.
GEORGE: You wanna see?! There! There it is! Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
GEORGE: You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! Serenity now!
GEORGE: You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
GEORGE: You want me to come back? Uh...
GEORGE: You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
GEORGE: You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
GEORGE: You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
GEORGE: You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
GEORGE: You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
GEORGE: You want to start?
GEORGE: You want your blankets tucked in?
GEORGE: You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, El Presidente?
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, sir?
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, sir?
GEORGE: You watch the old videos. I'm telling you, look at him.
GEORGE: You went for the big E.
GEORGE: You went home with him?
GEORGE: You were gonna fix me up with her?
GEORGE: You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
GEORGE: You weren't thinking.
GEORGE: You wha?
GEORGE: You what?
GEORGE: You what?!
GEORGE: You will?
GEORGE: You won the choose.
GEORGE: You won't regret this, sir.
GEORGE: You won't think I'm a bad person?
GEORGE: You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
GEORGE: You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
GEORGE: You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
GEORGE: You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
GEORGE: You yearn.
GEORGE: You'll do it?
GEORGE: You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...Dear God! Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
GEORGE: You'll pay? I'm there.
GEORGE: You'll see I'm right.
GEORGE: You're *damn* right it's me.

GEORGE: You're doing all the leg work.
GEORGE: You're fresh You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
GEORGE: You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
GEORGE: You're giving me the it's not you, it's me routine? I invented it's not you, it's me. Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.

GEORGE: You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
GEORGE: You're letting him have a woman over?!
GEORGE: You're listening to this?

GEORGE: You're making more than I am.
GEORGE: You're Murphy!
GEORGE: You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
GEORGE: You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
GEORGE: You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
GEORGE: You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
GEORGE: You're not going to get back here in time!
GEORGE: You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
GEORGE: You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
GEORGE: You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
GEORGE: You're on that list.
GEORGE: You're out?
GEORGE: You're out?!
GEORGE: You're parents saw me on TV?
GEORGE: You're right, how did I miss that? Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
GEORGE: You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
GEORGE: You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
GEORGE: You're selling computers?
GEORGE: You're sleepin' with the maid?
GEORGE: You're smart, I'm dumb.
GEORGE: You're so uptight.
GEORGE: You're sorry?!
GEORGE: You're soured?

GEORGE: You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
GEORGE: You're very special.
GEORGE: You're with a *woman*!
GEORGE: You're you.

GEORGE: You've got a bet.
GEORGE: You've got a prayer.
GEORGE: You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
GEORGE: You've made Jerry very happy.
GEORGE: You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
GEORGE: You've never seen this before?
GEORGE: You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
GEORGE: You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
GEORGE: You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?
GEORGE: You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
GEORGE: You, uh, you like baseball?
GEORGE: You-you sure you never slept with her? Perfect.
GEORGE: You?
GEORGE: Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
GEORGE: Your buttocks are spectacular.
GEORGE: Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
GEORGE: Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
GEORGE: Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
GEORGE: Your hair?
GEORGE: Your hose! Where's your hose?!
GEORGE: Your idea?
GEORGE: Your lawyer wears a cape...?
GEORGE: Your own show?
GEORGE: Your parents are going to Paris right?
GEORGE: Your parents'll never let you do it.
GEORGE: Your wake up guy asked you out?
GEORGE: Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
GEORGE: Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
GEORGE: Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
GEORGE: Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
GEORGE: Youre gonna be neighbors.
GEORGE: Youre gonna overdry it.
GEORGE: Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
GEORGE: Yuh. What about physically?
GEORGE: Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
GEORGE: Yup.
GEORGE: Yup.
GEORGE: Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
GEORGE: YYYDDSSHE ... Jose Jimenez. You recognize it?
GEORGE: Zing.
GEORGE: Cause its all in the greeting.
GEORGE: Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
GEORGE: Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
GEORGE: George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
GEORGE: How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
GEORGE: Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
GEORGE: Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
GEORGE: Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
GEORGE: Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
GEORGE: You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
GEORGE: All right, just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
GEORGE:..and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
GEORGE:Ahhhhh...
GEORGE:I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?
GEORGE:Oh, art!
GEPETTO: Smart choice.
GEPETTO: They don't make these any more. The work is, is all done by hand. Takes years, and years, and... Sylvia! For crying out, you're forty-five minutes late!
GEPETTO: They left you home alone, huh?
GEPETTO: Well, I can have the table ready for you on Monday.
GERMAN WOMAN: Somebody, stop him! Please, quick. Stop, it's him. I know, I know. Help. Stop him.

GILLIAN: Jerry?
GILLIAN: Make a wish.
GILLIAN: Very nice to meet you.
GILLIAN: Well, then at least drink your beer..
GILLIAN: Would you like some bread, Jerry?
GILLIAN: Yeah. All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?
GILLIAN: You have a little something on your face.
GINA: A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
GINA: All right. Go ahead.
GINA: Are you afraid of him?
GINA: Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
GINA: Come on.
GINA: Come, you walk me to a cab.
GINA: Forget it. Come on.
GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake.
GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
GINA: Hi.
GINA: How are you?
GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
GINA: I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
GINA: I wasnt.
GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth . Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
GINA: Its Gina.
GINA: Martines girl friend.
GINA: No, go ahead.
GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
GINA: Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
GINA: Tell me about them. Everything.
GINA: Tell me everything.
GINA: The junior?
GINA: Then kiss me right in front of him.
GINA: Then kiss me.
GINA: There is no time.
GINA: We dont have enough time.
GINA: When?
GINA: Who are these Stooges you speak of?
GINA: Will you just get it.
GINA: Yes, right here.
GINA: You dont want to?
GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
GINA: You next door neighbour.
GINA: You will show me The Stooges?
GINA: Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
GINO: Apologize?
GINO: Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He staring at the hair.
GINO: Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.
GINO: Don't Jerry.
GINO: He knows. He knows about us.
GINO: He make me cry too. You want something to drink?
GINO: He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.
GINO: Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.
GINO: I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.
GINO: I don't think Uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
GINO: I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.
GINO: It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.
GINO: Just a second. Yes.
GINO: No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
GINO: Nothing. It's just hair.
GINO: So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the best movie I've ever seen.
GINO: Sure, I fix. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair.
GINO: Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?
GINO: Yes it's true.
GIRL: Mickey you were so incredible in that scene yesterday, the rage.
GIRL: Now we finish it.
GIRLFRIEND: Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!
GIRLFRIEND: I'm from Witchita, so...
GIRLFRIEND: I'm really happy the movie was sold out.
GIRLFRIEND: That was close!
GIRLFRIEND: You were so fast with those keys.
GIULIANI: It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat.
GIULIANI: My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt.
GLADYS: Be with you in a minute. No, you shoulda come last night, it was fun.
GLADYS: Do you need some help with something?
GLADYS: I know, the margaritas in that place are so strong.
GLADYS: I own this store.
GLADYS: I'm Gladys Mayo.
GLADYS: Ladies, care for some chips?
GLADYS: Listen, I'll call you back. Yes? What can I do for you?
GLADYS: So? What else is goin' on?
GLADYS: Some of those are women's clothes.
GLADYS: Well, lemme show you what we have.
GLADYS: Yeah.
GLENDA: I don't' wear a wig.
GLENDA: I thought you quit.
GLENDA: What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.
GLENDA: What are you doing here?
GLENDA: What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.
GLENN: Ah, should I light a fire?
GLENN: Can you get that, please?
GLENN: Elaine, wow, a TV, a stereo?
GLENN: Hey, go tell hell!
GLENN: I might ask you the same thing.
GLENN: I think it'd be better if I called you.
GLENN: I think this will burn!
GLENN: I think you're very beautiful.
GLENN: I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here.
GLENN: It's a bag of donuts.
GLENN: It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.
GLENN: It's a surprise.
GLENN: It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.
GLENN: Looks like it.
GLENN: Mm mm... no, not really.
GLENN: No, no, no, no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here.
GLENN: Oh, my God, Alison. You're home early.
GLENN: Oh, no.
GLENN: Oooh!
GLENN: So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?
GLENN: So, um, why don't we get together some time?
GLENN: Um, uh, no one, no one. Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on.
GLENN: You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life.
GOERGE: Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..
GOERGE: You like gum? 'Cause I have a friend in the gum business. I got a gum guy. I make one phone call. I got boxes of delivered right to your door.
GREENY: I'm gonna get some food. You want some?
GREG: By the way, you look really great in that leotard.
GREG: Can I have a sip of your water?
GREG: Do you have to be somewhere?
GREG: Haven't seen you in a while.
GREG: Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.
GREG: Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night.
GREG: I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too.
GREG: I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives?
GREG: Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out.
GREG: Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?
GREG: Oh. Well, it was good seeing you.
GREG: See that guy right there?
GREG: Thanks.
GREG: Then what are you doing?
GREG: Very.
GREG: Wait-wait, ten-thirty. Sorry.
GREG: Well, I-I gotta take off.
GREG: Why?
GREG: Would ya?
GREG: Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.
GREG: Yeah. Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here.
GREG: You ran the Mini-Marathon?
GROSSBARD: Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30...
GROUP: Yeah!
GROUP: Yeah!
GUAD: Hey, hold it!
GUARD: All right, let's go...
GUARD: Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.
GUARD: At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.
GUARD: Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.
GUARD: Go ahead.
GUARD: I don't know.
GUARD: I don't need a chair.
GUARD: I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.
GUARD: I'll get that.
GUARD: Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle?
GUARD: Mr. Ross says this is O.K.?
GUARD: No.
GUARD: Nope.
GUARD: Not bad. Not bad at all.
GUARD: Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.
GUARD: Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this. Swarm! Swarm!
GUARD: Well who wouldn't?
GUARD: What?
GUARD: Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.
GUARD: You're under arrest.
GUILLERMO: ...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba!
GUILLERMO: Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off!
GUILLERMO: Jerry Seinfeld please.
GUILLERMO: Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your Magic Pan crepe restaurants...
GUILLERMO: We are the Cubans.
GUILLERMO: What cigars?
GUY ON PHONE: Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?

GUY: I'll go get some more beer.
GUY: I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.
GUY: If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.

GUY: Oh, Ann Landers sucks!
GUY: Ok, come on.
GUY: On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man devoted his whole life to the peanut. Imagine having so much passion for something.

GUY: Really? Well, that's very nice.

GUY: Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.
GUY: Yeah, you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want in?
GUY: Yeah.
GUY: Yes?
GWEN: All right, George, it's you.
GWEN: Hey.
GWEN: Hey.
GWEN: Hi.
GWEN: How?
GWEN: I can go either way.
GWEN: I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.
GWEN: I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.
GWEN: I just found a rubber band in my soup.
GWEN: I think I'm just gonna go.
GWEN: I was just trying to...
GWEN: I'm dating your friend, Jerry..
GWEN: I'm sorry George.
GWEN: I'm sure you do it very well.
GWEN: It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop.
GWEN: It's not you, it's me.
GWEN: Jerry!
GWEN: Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?
GWEN: Jerry.. hi.
GWEN: Kramer told me.
GWEN: Kramer, Hi!
GWEN: No I didn't. I said sweep. Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up.
GWEN: So, you ready to go?
GWEN: That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.
GWEN: What? You're crazy.
GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.
GWEN: Yeah.
GWEN: Yes sweep.
GWEN: You know, you might want to take the tunnel.
GWEN: You were expecting someone else?
GX: So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.
HAARWOOD: Certainly.
HAARWOOD: I'm a little ticklish.
HAARWOOD: Mmm, yes, yes.
HAARWOOD: Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.
HAARWOOD: Oh yes, of course you can.
HAARWOOD: Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe.
HAARWOOD: They're half-glasses.
HAARWOOD: Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute.
HAARWOOD: Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.
HAARWOOD: Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat generous proportions.
HAARWOOD: Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?
HAARWOOD: Yes, it was in the lost and found.
HAARWOOD: Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory.
HAARWOOD: Yes, yes, it is.
HAFFLER: Awright, partner. Let's get down to business.
HAFFLER: Dennis Castro?
HAFFLER: Get the hell outta my office.
HAFFLER: I thought he quit smoking cigars.
HAFFLER: We're talking about people, right?
HAFFLER: You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you?
HAIRDRESSER: So, what do you want to do?
HAIRDRESSER: The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.
HAL: And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed?
HAL: But this isn't still going on.
HAL: Claming?
HAL: Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended.
HAL: Great for the back. Right.
HAL: Hey, Kramer.
HAL: I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.
HAL: I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.
HAL: I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.
HAL: I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients.
HAL: It's just more cheese.
HAL: Kitzmiller.
HAL: Kitzmiller.
HAL: Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?
HAL: Not this one. It's called the Lumbar Yard.
HAL: Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back.
HAL: So are you liking the mattress?
HAL: So you do like the mattress?
HAL: That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?
HAL: They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?
HAL: What is that smell?
HAL: You and Elaine are pretty close.
HALLIE: C'mon.
HALLIE: Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.
HALLIE: How embarrassing this must be for you.
HALLIE: I'll see you at the wedding.
HALLIE: It got a little dirty, so they wanted to clean it before they gave it back to you.
HALLIE: Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.
HALLIE: Mmm, it is good.
HALLIE: No, it's not.
HALLIE: Oh. Remember wedding?
HALLIE: This is the jacket.
HALLIE: Well, they perform all over. Europe mostly.
HALLIE: Yeah.
HALLIE: Yeah.
HALLIE: Yeah.
HALLIE: Yeah.
HANKE: All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater.
HANKE: All right, look, you know--
HANKE: Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, you know, when we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even have called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, but I always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry.
HANKE: Apology? For what?
HANKE: George, come on, not that neck hole thing.
HANKE: George.
HANKE: George. Thanks for coming down to talk to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very flexible. I just started yesterday.
HANKE: Great. Great. Well, I'll see you guys later.
HANKE: Guys, there's no doubt that the pay is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice cream.
HANKE: Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going through the Twelve Steps.
HANKE: Hi, I'm, uh, Jason. I'm a rage-aholic.
HANKE: I don't know if I'm into that.
HANKE: I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I was wrong, so what more do you want from me?
HANKE: I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What are you looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!
HANKE: It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck.
HANKE: No way, you would've completely stretched it out.
HANKE: Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone here, if you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry.
HANKE: Please. Step Nine.
HANKE: Uh, this is my first meeting.
HANKE: Waffle or sugar cone?
HANKE: Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought it over, and, you know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve much better.
HANKE: What?
HANKE: Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?
HANKE: Yeah. Making amends.
HANKE: You're welcome.
HAROLD: Because its true! Why shouldnt I tell him?
HAROLD: Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I dont want to do it. Manny wants to do it.
HAROLD: Hi, Jerry.
HAROLD: I told you I dont like these sponges, theyre too small! I want a big sponge!
HAROLD: I was only joking. He thinks Im gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalkers things.
HAROLD: Im not going up. It stinks up there.
HAROLD: Im not going.
HAROLD: Im not the one who said eleven oclock. He makes up his own rules.
HAROLD: Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair.
HAROLD: Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didnt have her wig on. It was horrifying.
HAROLD: No, Im not going up there.
HAROLD: Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me.
HAROLD: Oh, Jerry.
HAROLD: Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, well give it to her.
HAROLD: Okay
HAROLD: Okay!
HAROLD: Okay...
HAROLD: Sure, sure. Shes getting a bargain, too. Its only four hundred dollars a month.
HAROLD: We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. Its a good thing her rent was overdue. Shed be rotting up there for a month.
HAROLD: Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported.
HAROLD: Whats the difference? Its true!
HAROLD: Whats the matter with you? Im talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?
HAROLD: Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalkers apartment?
HAROLD: You cant pick up anything with these! Theres no absorption!
HAROLD: Your friend cant have the apartment, Jerry.
HEAD: Holy cow!
HEAD: Holy cow!
HEAD: Holy cow!
HEALTH INSPECTOR: All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie.
HEALTH INSPECTOR: Are you Poppie?
HEALTH INSPECTOR: Board of health, we've had several complaints.
HEALTH INSPECTOR: I think you'd better come with me.
HELEN: ...30...31...
HELEN: ...32...
HELEN: A discount on dry-cleaning?
HELEN: A what?
HELEN: Aaron is quite the tour guide.
HELEN: Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.
HELEN: Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
HELEN: All they serve is chicken?
HELEN: Alright, we'll wait. But it's unheard of.
HELEN: And didn't the three hours go by just like that
HELEN: And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
HELEN: And they liked the idea?
HELEN: And this other ones the one?
HELEN: And whens the funeral?
HELEN: Are you okay?
HELEN: Are you out of your mind?
HELEN: Are you sure?
HELEN: At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
HELEN: Because you made such a big fuss about it.
HELEN: Besides, that condo was too much house.
HELEN: Blanche.
HELEN: Blanche?
HELEN: Buh bye.
HELEN: Bum bum bum bum...
HELEN: Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
HELEN: But how long can you look?
HELEN: But it's real. It's water.
HELEN: But its their 50th anniversary.
HELEN: But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
HELEN: But your back hurts.
HELEN: Bye bye, Jerry.
HELEN: Can they do that?
HELEN: Cereal.
HELEN: Congratulations, they're doing the show.
HELEN: Cuz we don't wann..
HELEN: Do the dog routine.
HELEN: Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
HELEN: Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
HELEN: Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
HELEN: Don't go.
HELEN: Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
HELEN: Don't worry, he's comfortable.
HELEN: Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.
HELEN: Doris.
HELEN: Elaine, I really--
HELEN: Elaine...
HELEN: Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
HELEN: Even so, the press would bury him!
HELEN: F. F, E, L, D.
HELEN: For fun?
HELEN: Four thousand apiece?
HELEN: George must be happy about that.
HELEN: Goodbye, Jerry.
HELEN: Goodnight.
HELEN: Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
HELEN: Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
HELEN: He broke the window?
HELEN: He calls every week. Are you all right?
HELEN: He didn't think you'd accpet.
HELEN: He has nothing to do.
HELEN: He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
HELEN: He likes looking.
HELEN: He looks better on TV.
HELEN: He loves that pen.
HELEN: He says he's fine.
HELEN: He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
HELEN: He turned it down?
HELEN: He used to go with her.
HELEN: He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
HELEN: He won't last a day in prison.
HELEN: He's after you?
HELEN: He's an idealist.
HELEN: He's joking.
HELEN: He's not buying us a Cadillac.
HELEN: He's not there?
HELEN: He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
HELEN: He's something, you son, isn't he?
HELEN: He's what?!
HELEN: Hello Aaron
HELEN: Hello, Hello.
HELEN: Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here.
HELEN: Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. You're giving him back that pen.
HELEN: Hello?... Hello?
HELEN: Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
HELEN: Hes kidding, Manya.
HELEN: Hi Elaine.
HELEN: Hi Jerry......What's wrong?
HELEN: Hi Kramer.
HELEN: Hi.
HELEN: Hi.
HELEN: How are you gonna get all this done in time?
HELEN: How can anyone not like him.
HELEN: How could anybody not like you?
HELEN: How could anyone not like him?
HELEN: How could you do such a thing?
HELEN: How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
HELEN: How could you still see her if your not interested?
HELEN: How could you?
HELEN: How did you know that?
HELEN: How much is a rent-a-car?
HELEN: Howbout A milk glass.
HELEN: Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
HELEN: I can do that.
HELEN: I can see if there was a weight problem...
HELEN: I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
HELEN: I don't even know how to work it.
HELEN: I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
HELEN: I don't know.
HELEN: I don't like all these open boxes.
HELEN: I don't think so.
HELEN: I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
HELEN: I dont have a dress to wear. And you. You dont have anything.
HELEN: I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
HELEN: I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
HELEN: I hate her like poison.
HELEN: I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight.
HELEN: I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
HELEN: I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
HELEN: I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
HELEN: I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now.
HELEN: I know what it was.
HELEN: I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.
HELEN: I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
HELEN: I think she's beautiful.
HELEN: I think you're out of your mind.
HELEN: I thought you were getting it.
HELEN: I told you it was good.
HELEN: I told you to let us sleep in there.
HELEN: I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
HELEN: I told you...
HELEN: I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
HELEN: I was very comfortable.
HELEN: I wouldn't be any trouble?
HELEN: I'll see. Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
HELEN: I'm afraid I don't.
HELEN: I'm bringing it for Jerry.
HELEN: I'm next.
HELEN: I'm not gonna ask her out.
HELEN: I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
HELEN: I'm right here.
HELEN: I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
HELEN: I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
HELEN: Idiot. So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
HELEN: If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
HELEN: If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
HELEN: Impeachment?
HELEN: Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
HELEN: Is that what she said?
HELEN: It looks ridiculous.
HELEN: It was a crime of passion.
HELEN: It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
HELEN: It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
HELEN: It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
HELEN: It was... different.
HELEN: It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
HELEN: It's four-thirty.
HELEN: It's from scuba diving.
HELEN: It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
HELEN: It's in the constitution.
HELEN: It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
HELEN: Its raining.
HELEN: Ill get it!
HELEN: Im not playing with you anymore.
HELEN: Jack, what are you doing?
HELEN: Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
HELEN: Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
HELEN: Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
HELEN: Jerry sends his laundry out.
HELEN: Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
HELEN: Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
HELEN: Jerry's glasses?
HELEN: Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
HELEN: Jerry, are you sure this all right?
HELEN: Jerry, be serious.
HELEN: Jerry, do your act.
HELEN: Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
HELEN: Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
HELEN: Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
HELEN: Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
HELEN: Jerry, Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
HELEN: Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.
HELEN: Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
HELEN: Jerry, no ones forcing you.
HELEN: Jerry, she's fantastic.
HELEN: Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
HELEN: Jerry, we can only stay four days.
HELEN: Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?
HELEN: Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
HELEN: Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
HELEN: Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.
HELEN: Jerry.
HELEN: Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
HELEN: Just like that? No calls?
HELEN: Just okay?
HELEN: Just what I said, here.
HELEN: Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
HELEN: Kramer?
HELEN: Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
HELEN: Leo says he's the best there is.
HELEN: Leo, where did you get that watch?
HELEN: Let me see that.
HELEN: Macadamian nuts?
HELEN: Maybe
HELEN: Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
HELEN: Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
HELEN: Maybe you've seen him on television.
HELEN: Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
HELEN: Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
HELEN: Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
HELEN: Morty, what are you doing?
HELEN: Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? There's already a box of cookies open.
HELEN: Morty, will you stop it!
HELEN: Morty, you're driving me crazy.
HELEN: Morty, you're talking too loud.
HELEN: Morty.
HELEN: Morty.
HELEN: Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
HELEN: Nana!!!
HELEN: Nice meeting you.
HELEN: No we don't mind
HELEN: No, he never heard you. I told you he didn't hear you.
HELEN: No, I don't think that.
HELEN: No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
HELEN: No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
HELEN: No, we'll stay in there.
HELEN: No, were taking a cab.
HELEN: No, why should we take over your apartment?
HELEN: No.
HELEN: No.
HELEN: No. I'm fine.

HELEN: Well we already saw it.
HELEN: Well you must have done something.
HELEN: Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
HELEN: Well you're not gonna say anything.
HELEN: Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
HELEN: Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
HELEN: Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
HELEN: Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
HELEN: Well, it's not the sofa.
HELEN: Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
HELEN: Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
HELEN: Well, what am I gonna do it in?

HELEN: What guy?
HELEN: What happened to your eyes?
HELEN: What happened?
HELEN: What happened?

HELEN: Why is he after you?
HELEN: Why not?
HELEN: Why would they? Know body bought them then.
HELEN: Why, you thinking of moving?
HELEN: Why?
HELEN: Why?
HELEN: Why?
HELEN: Will you challenge it?
HELEN: Will you stop?
HELEN: With the instructor?
HELEN: Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
HELEN: Wondering what?
HELEN: Yay! Jerry got it open.
HELEN: Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
HELEN: Yeah.
HELEN: Yes.
HELEN: Yes. Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
HELEN: You came all the way from Florida to see him.
HELEN: You could have used our car.
HELEN: You could've taken it with you.
HELEN: You didn't have to take it.
HELEN: You didn't have to throw it out.
HELEN: You don't mind to you Elaine?
HELEN: You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
HELEN: You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
HELEN: You find something you get a fee.
HELEN: You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
HELEN: You have to
HELEN: You have to go see him.
HELEN: You just sat there.
HELEN: You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
HELEN: You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
HELEN: You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
HELEN: You know, you should give Manya a call.
HELEN: You should be more mature.
HELEN: You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do?
HELEN: You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
HELEN: You want me to get that?
HELEN: You want my urine?
HELEN: You were making out during Schindler's List?
HELEN: You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
HELEN: You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.
HELEN: You're crazy.
HELEN: You're going underwater?
HELEN: You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
HELEN: You're hot?
HELEN: You're hurting my eardrum.
HELEN: You're kidding.
HELEN: You're not buying us dinner.
HELEN: You're not paying.
HELEN: You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
HELEN: Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
HELEN: Your father doesn't need a car.
HELEN: Your friend Kramer doesnt mind?
HELEN: Youre not wearing that to a funeral.
HELEN: Youre such a stickler...
HELEN: Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
HELEN: Quo. Is that a word?
HELENA: But it's too late.
HELENA: But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake.
HELENA: He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.
HELENA: Hello Kramer.
HELENA: I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?
HELENA: I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.
HELENA: I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer!
HELENA: It was a Three Stooges short, Sappy Pappy. I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?
HELENA: Moe hits Curly with an axe,
HELENA: No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it.
HELENA: The baby's dead.
HELENA: The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.
HELENA: The Stooges catch the kidnappers,
HELENA: Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,
HELENA: Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?
HELENA: Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.

HOLLY: Everybody like mutton?
HOLLY: Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?
HOLLY: Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?
HOLLY: I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before.
HOLLY: I decided I was going to make you dinner.
HOLLY: I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,
HOLLY: It's Holly.
HOLLY: Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.
HOLLY: Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions.
HOLLY: So, is the chop the way you like it?
HOLLY: That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
HOLLY: That was in Grandma's study.
HOLLY: Then who did?
HOLLY: They're grandma Memma's.
HOLLY: Was it mutton?
HOLLY: Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.
HOLLY: What about the napkins?
HOLLY: When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.
HOLLY: Where are the napkins?
HOLLY: Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.
HOLLY: You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!
HOLLY: You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.
HOLLY: Your butcher, down the street.HOMELESS MAN 2: I'll take the job. Potato salad!

HOUSEKEEPER: No English.
HOUSEKEEPER: Sid Fields.
HOYT: A what?
HOYT: Alright, Detective, then what happened?
HOYT: And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
HOYT: And then what happened?
HOYT: And then what happened?
HOYT: And then you left the bakery.
HOYT: And what was your connection to the defendants?
HOYT: And what's your connection to the defendant?
HOYT: And what's your occupation?
HOYT: And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
HOYT: Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
HOYT: But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?
HOYT: Call Donald Sanger to the stand.
HOYT: Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
HOYT: Call Mabel Choate to the stand.
HOYT: Call Sidra Holland to the stand.
HOYT: Call Yev Kassem to the stand.
HOYT: Cock fighting?
HOYT: Contest?
HOYT: Could you spell that?
HOYT: Did one of them have a video camera?
HOYT: Excuse me?
HOYT: How did she try to kill you?
HOYT: How do you know the defendants?
HOYT: How long was his book overdue?
HOYT: I call Marla Penny to the stand.
HOYT: It's alright. Take your time.
HOYT: It's okay.
HOYT: Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.
HOYT: Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
HOYT: No further questions.
HOYT: No further questions.
HOYT: Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th.
HOYT: So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp.
HOYT: So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992.
HOYT: So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
HOYT: So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?
HOYT: So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything.
HOYT: So they just stood there and did nothing?
HOYT: So they were just standing there?
HOYT: So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
HOYT: So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
HOYT: So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was?
HOYT: So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?
HOYT: So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?
HOYT: So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?
HOYT: State your name.
HOYT: State your name.
HOYT: The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
HOYT: Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.
HOYT: Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!
HOYT: We are, Your Honor.
HOYT: We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.
HOYT: What did he want?
HOYT: What do you call them?
HOYT: What does a library cop do?
HOYT: What was that?
HOYT: What was the nature of the contest?
HOYT: Why would she do something like that?
HOYT: Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
HOYT: Yes?
HOYT: Yes?
HOYT: You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?
HOYT: Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.
HOYT: Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.
HOYT: Your marble rye?

ISAAC: Oh, the apartment. Jeffreys taking the apartment.
ISAAC: Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya wouldve liked Phoenix.
ISABEL: Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.
ISABEL: I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you.
ISABEL: Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you.
ISABEL: That's not the line, Jerry.
ISABEL: What crop circles?
ISABEL: Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.

IZZY: Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.
IZZY: Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
IZZY: Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
IZZY: Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
IZZY: Hello, dough boy.
IZZY: Hi, son.
IZZY: How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
IZZY: I got married in high school.
IZZY: I still thought you could do it.
IZZY: I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
IZZY: I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
IZZY: If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.

IZZY: Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
IZZY: Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?

IZZY: Oh, I see how it works now. He knocks me outta commission, so you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. Well, I'll show you who's number one.
IZZY: Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
IZZY: Okay.
IZZY: Step aside, stringbean.
IZZY: That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
IZZY: The best in the world. Which means I'm better than just number one.
IZZY: The television.
IZZY: Think you're better than me, huh?

IZZY: Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
IZZY: Yeah.
IZZY: Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
IZZY: You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.
IZZY: You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?
IZZY: Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
JACK: All right!
JACK: Alright how the hell do I know?
JACK: Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
JACK: Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities.
JACK: Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
JACK: But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks.
JACK: C'mon Morty, the jig is up!
JACK: Come on!
JACK: Come on, take the pen!
JACK: Danny's? C'mon!
JACK: Do me a personal favor!
JACK: Do whatever you want. It's your car.
JACK: Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
JACK: Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
JACK: Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.
JACK: Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
JACK: Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?
JACK: Excuse me. Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. The shoes have to match the pocketbook. What's she doing? Yoga?
JACK: Get the hell outta here with your knob.
JACK: Go ahead.
JACK: He gave it to me!
JACK: He what?
JACK: Hello Jerry,
JACK: Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.
JACK: Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.
JACK: Hello Morty. Well, missed the early bird.
JACK: Hello, Jerry.
JACK: Hey. Hi Cosmo.
JACK: His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.
JACK: I can't believe you got that old bag.
JACK: I did NOT have a coke.
JACK: I did not.
JACK: I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
JACK: I don't wanna take a ride.
JACK: I don't want it!
JACK: I gotta fix your window now?
JACK: I thought you're going to Paris
JACK: I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
JACK: I'll bet you don't.
JACK: I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
JACK: I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
JACK: I'm gonna be in the can.
JACK: I'm kidding.
JACK: I'm not sitting down!
JACK: I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
JACK: I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
JACK: It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
JACK: It's Jack Klompus.
JACK: It's: 19.45$, Morty.
JACK: Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
JACK: Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
JACK: Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
JACK: Listen do you think I give a damn?
JACK: Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
JACK: Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
JACK: Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
JACK: Must be nice to have that kind of money.
JACK: Need a pen?
JACK: Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
JACK: No, thank you.
JACK: No. thanks, no.
JACK: No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? All right. I owe you 19.45$ .
JACK: Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
JACK: Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
JACK: Oh it was a gift.
JACK: Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!
JACK: Ow! You broke my dental plate! Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you.
JACK: Positive! Take the pen!
JACK: Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
JACK: Raincoats? You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
JACK: See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.
JACK: So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
JACK: So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?
JACK: So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
JACK: So uh where's your father?
JACK: So when are you coming down to Florida again?
JACK: So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?
JACK: Some car.
JACK: Still works.
JACK: Stop it!
JACK: Take the pen!
JACK: Take the pen!
JACK: Take the pen.
JACK: Thank you.
JACK: That's what you think.
JACK: The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
JACK: There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
JACK: They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
JACK: This happens to be my pen.
JACK: This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
JACK: This pen?
JACK: This thing is a, is a behemoth.
JACK: W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
JACK: Well I mean...
JACK: What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
JACK: What boxes?
JACK: What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
JACK: What for?
JACK: What happened to you?
JACK: What took you so long?
JACK: What's in the boxes?
JACK: What's there to see underwater?
JACK: What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?
JACK: When do you want these?
JACK: Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
JACK: Who died?
JACK: Who's car?
JACK: Whose pen?
JACK: Ya
JACK: Yaah!
JACK: Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
JACK: Yeah.
JACK: Yes, we will.
JACK: You are uh, thinking of staying here?
JACK: You bought it?
JACK: You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
JACK: You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
JACK: You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
JACK: You what?
JACK: You're not me.
JACK: You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
JACK: Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
JACK: Your son?
JACK: Yours?
JACKIE : This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bras gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!
JACKIE: 20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
JACKIE: A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
JACKIE: And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
JACKIE: And you have also brought with you, another bra, exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!
JACKIE: Attempted murder? Of whom?
JACKIE: Could you repeat that?
JACKIE: Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
JACKIE: Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
JACKIE: Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
JACKIE: Free coffee?
JACKIE: Half milk, half coffee?
JACKIE: Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?
JACKIE: Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
JACKIE: Hm Hm. You take a sip?
JACKIE: How much?
JACKIE: I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
JACKIE: I don't want nothing to do with it.
JACKIE: I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
JACKIE: I said out.
JACKIE: I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
JACKIE: I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
JACKIE: I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
JACKIE: It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
JACKIE: Jackie.
JACKIE: Like taking candy from a baby.
JACKIE: Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
JACKIE: Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?
JACKIE: My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
JACKIE: No further questions, your honor.
JACKIE: No money? Then what'd we get?
JACKIE: No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
JACKIE: No top? She didn't have a top on?
JACKIE: No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
JACKIE: No, no, no, no!
JACKIE: Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
JACKIE: Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
JACKIE: O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?
JACKIE: O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
JACKIE: Oh no.
JACKIE: Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
JACKIE: Oh. Cosmo Kramer?
JACKIE: Pull over here driver this is it.
JACKIE: Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
JACKIE: So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
JACKIE: So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
JACKIE: So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
JACKIE: So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
JACKIE: So. Then what happened?
JACKIE: Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
JACKIE: Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
JACKIE: Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?
JACKIE: That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!
JACKIE: The who?
JACKIE: The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
JACKIE: Then what happened?
JACKIE: This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
JACKIE: Was there a top on it?
JACKIE: Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman?
JACKIE: Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.
JACKIE: Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
JACKIE: Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?
JACKIE: Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
JACKIE: Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
JACKIE: You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
JACKIE: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
JACKIE: You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!
JACKIE: Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
JACKIE: Your face is my case.
JACKIE: Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
JAKE: Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
JAKE: Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
JAKE: Goodnight!
JAKE: Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
JAKE: I can't tell you that.
JAKE: I would like to be alone now, please.
JAKE: I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
JAKE: If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
JAKE: Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. Give me those! I want the glasses! Give me those!
JAKE: Lets see, they are here they are.
JAKE: No thanks.
JAKE: Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
JAKE: Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.
JAKE: Ooh...
JAKE: She did.
JAKE: So that's what you came down here to tell me?
JAKE: So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
JAKE: So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
JAKE: So?
JAKE: Tell me.
JAKE: Then when did you get those?
JAKE: Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
JAKE: Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
JAKE: Well, you can put one on this one: I'm leaving!
JAKE: Well, you notice anything?
JAKE: What are you talking about?
JAKE: What is it?
JAKE: What's so curious about it?
JAKE: What?
JAKE: Where did you get those?
JAKE: Where did you get those?
JAKE: Where did you get those?
JAKE: Where do you keep the corkscrew?
JAKE: Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
JAKE: You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
JAKE: You never said hi?
JAKE: You still like me, don't you?
JAKE: You're saying you didn't say hi.
JAMES: A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your waking up alone.

JAMES: Elaine?

JAMES: This is your wake up service. It's 7:15
JAMES: Yeah, you know, when you live alone, you're dogs are all you have. Do you like dogs?

JANET: well maybe we do look a little like each other.
JANET: Well, you told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before.
JANET: You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus.
JANICE: Ive never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. Its a shame youre married.
JANICE: Please...
JAY LENO: Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family?
JAY: By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky.
JAY: He hasn't been well.
JAY: He must be worried about the fall schedule.
JAY: Hi, Jay Crespi.
JAY: It's like a... white discoloration.
JAY: Mm, I'm not-
JAY: Nice meeting you.
JAY: That thing you did having the two guys running through? I love stuff you don't have to think too much about.
JAY: That's right.
JAY: Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!
JEANINE: Eddie Sherman is here.
JEANINE: Eddie Sherman.
JEANNIE: ... all that crap.
JEANNIE: Bowl of Corn flakes.
JEANNIE: Georgie boy..
JEANNIE: Hello.
JEANNIE: Hey! Hey! Look out. OK!, Are you okay?
JEANNIE: Hey! So what's the deal with brunch, I mean that if it's a combination of breakfast and lunch. How comes there's no lupper or no linner.
JEANNIE: Hey! what's the deal with decaf; how do they get the caffeine out of there and then where does it go?
JEANNIE: I like it.
JEANNIE: I'll have a bowl of Cheerios, not to much milk.
JEANNIE: Jeannie Steinman.
JEANNIE: See ya.
JEANNIE: Shouldn't there be some kind of reward for that.
JEANNIE: That's a shame..
JEANNIE: The shirt you got on under your sweather. It sits for three weeks in your drawer, waiting to come out. and when it finally does . It sticks up only half an inch out of your collar.
JEANNIE: Yeah I think it's the same thing.
JEANNIE: You know you should be a lot more careful crossing the street like that, otherwise you could die.. If that bothers you.
JEANNIE: You see.. To me this is a waste.
JEANNIE: You too.?...
JEFF: Great idea.
JEFF: Hi Mary.
JENNA: Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess.
JENNA: Bye.
JENNA: Do you hear something?
JENNA: Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure.
JENNA: Good.
JENNA: Gotta run.
JENNA: Hey.
JENNA: Hi.
JENNA: Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour.
JENNA: How you feeling?
JENNA: I was really happy with my old toothbrush.
JENNA: I'm gonna grab you a towel.
JENNA: It's like I'm holding a blender.
JENNA: Just eating away at you isn't it?
JENNA: Mm.
JENNA: Mmm. My mouth feels so clean.
JENNA: Morning.
JENNA: Really, it does?
JENNA: So Jerry, why'd you call me?
JENNA: There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet.
JENNA: Toilet brush.
JENNA: Uh, Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you.
JENNA: What?
JENNA: What?!
JENNA: When were you gonna tell me this?!
JENNA: Yes, I did.
JENNA: You wanna order dinner?
JENNY: I want them out of here.
JENNY: I'm going to bed!
JENNY: It's two o'clock in the morning.
JENNY: Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.
JENNY: No! I am not going to bed with them in our house, this is ridiculous.
JENNY: No, not really.
JENNY: You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.
JERR: Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
JERRY : All right.
JERRY : Have you thought any more about that trip?
JERRY : I dont think so.
JERRY : I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
JERRY : I paid what it costs.
JERRY : I think Ive seen enough.
JERRY : It was the single worst moment of my life.
JERRY : Im good, thanks.
JERRY : Really, Im not answering anymore.
JERRY : So what are you gonna do?
JERRY : Yello.

JERRY, GEORGE, ELAINE: Don't worry. We won't forget!
JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN: Astronaut!
JERRY:  But I'm damaged goods now.
JERRY:  Yeah! What's that.
JERRY: $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
JERRY: $875?
JERRY: '... downtown.'
JERRY: '...down town.'
JERRY: '...downtown.'
JERRY: '...downtown.'
JERRY: '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
JERRY: '90.
JERRY: 'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
JERRY: 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
JERRY: 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
JERRY: 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
JERRY: 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
JERRY: 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
JERRY: 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
JERRY: 'Kay.
JERRY: 'Maybe'!?
JERRY: 'Pottery Barn'?
JERRY: 's not necessary.
JERRY: 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
JERRY: 'Scuse me.
JERRY: 'scuse me?
JERRY: 'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?
JERRY: 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
JERRY: 'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
JERRY: 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
JERRY: *I* don't like you!
JERRY: *Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...
JERRY: *We*? No.
JERRY: --but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
JERRY: -programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
JERRY: .
JERRY: . . . All right Just give me the ticket.
JERRY: . . . HE ended it?
JERRY: . . . I can't.
JERRY: . . . it's uh, being fixed.
JERRY: . . . Poor bastard.
JERRY: . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
JERRY: .. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
JERRY: ... Could you move over there?!
JERRY: ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
JERRY: ... I think. Have some more wine.
JERRY: ... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
JERRY: ... Oh, Im joking.
JERRY: ... this is all .. very confusing.
JERRY: ... um ...
JERRY: ...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-
JERRY: ...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!
JERRY: ...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
JERRY: ....
JERRY: ........For spite...
JERRY: .......Sure.
JERRY: ......laugh, everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
JERRY: .....Stupid, stupid.
JERRY: ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower, get his soap, rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest. ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.

JERRY: ...all right!
JERRY: ...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
JERRY: ...and he told me that that...
JERRY: ...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something: if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
JERRY: ...back, please?
JERRY: ...But with punching and kicking.
JERRY: ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable.

JERRY: ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
JERRY: ...Kramer
JERRY: ...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now. This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration. You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, Here's fifty-six people that know me. Cop goes. Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check.
JERRY: ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.

JERRY: ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
JERRY: ..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...

And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
JERRY: Ah
JERRY: Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you... I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!

JERRY: All right, all right. Here. .
JERRY: All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together.

JERRY: All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
JERRY: All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, It's been real, move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
JERRY: All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
JERRY: All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.

JERRY: Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
JERRY: Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
JERRY: Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. I'm going to the bathroom.
JERRY: Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you
JERRY: Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. &gt;click click click&lt;...
JERRY: Alright, he just left. We can go.
JERRY: Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
JERRY: Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
JERRY: Alright, how much does he owe you?
JERRY: Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
JERRY: Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say Hi, and I say Hello.
JERRY: Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
JERRY: Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
JERRY: Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
JERRY: Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
JERRY: Alright, I'll call him.
JERRY: Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
JERRY: Alright, I'll feel him out.
JERRY: Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
JERRY: Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
JERRY: Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
JERRY: Alright, I'll see you later.
JERRY: Alright, I'll see you later.
JERRY: Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
JERRY: Alright, I'll take it.
JERRY: Alright, I'll talk to you later.
JERRY: Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
JERRY: Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
JERRY: Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?
JERRY: Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
JERRY: Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here, here, or here .
JERRY: Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
JERRY: Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
JERRY: Alright, its time to go.
JERRY: Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
JERRY: Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
JERRY: Alright, Kramer!
JERRY: Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. C'mon, let's get it together.. Yeah?
JERRY: Alright, let's go.
JERRY: Alright, let's just get to work. NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
JERRY: Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
JERRY: Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
JERRY: Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye.
JERRY: Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
JERRY: Alright, Newman! This is it!
JERRY: Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
JERRY: Alright, she's free. Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
JERRY: Alright, shut up, here they come.
JERRY: Alright, sit down, sit down.
JERRY: Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
JERRY: Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.
JERRY: Alright, take 'em.
JERRY: Alright, thanks again.
JERRY: Alright, that's enough.
JERRY: Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
JERRY: Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
JERRY: Alright, that's it..
JERRY: Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
JERRY: Alright, that's very good. Thank you.
JERRY: Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
JERRY: Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
JERRY: Alright, want to start?
JERRY: Alright, we're coming down.
JERRY: Alright, well what if we say...
JERRY: Alright, well. Just, start again, then.
JERRY: Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?
JERRY: Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
JERRY: Alright. Excuse me, this is your party, right?
JERRY: Alright. Forget it.
JERRY: Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
JERRY: Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up.
JERRY: Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
JERRY: Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
JERRY: Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
JERRY: Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
JERRY: Alright. So?
JERRY: Alright..
JERRY: Alright..
JERRY: Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.
JERRY: Also with her hands.
JERRY: Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable... Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been outed! I wasn't even in!
JERRY: Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
JERRY: Always helpful.
JERRY: Always popular.
JERRY: Always works?
JERRY: Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
JERRY: Am I finally getting a baby brother?
JERRY: Am I going? It was three nights ago.
JERRY: Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
JERRY: Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
JERRY: Am not.
JERRY: Am not.
JERRY: AM/PM.
JERRY: Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
JERRY: AMCA?
JERRY: Amy and Jeffrey?
JERRY: Amy said nothing happened.
JERRY: An alliance. Now get the hell outta here.
JERRY: An Army Pete.
JERRY: An assembly?
JERRY: An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
JERRY: An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
JERRY: An overdose of odor? Good question.
JERRY: An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
JERRY: An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! I am not an animal!
JERRY: and
JERRY: And . .
JERRY: And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
JERRY: And a dead bolt.
JERRY: And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!
JERRY: And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
JERRY: And by then you've lost interest.
JERRY: And did they suspect anything?
JERRY: And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, That's funny. ... That's funny!
JERRY: And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
JERRY: And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids.
JERRY: And gum.
JERRY: And he didn't remember you?
JERRY: And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
JERRY: And here's the beauty--
JERRY: and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
JERRY: And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
JERRY: And I'm always impressed.
JERRY: And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
JERRY: And if you do?
JERRY: And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
JERRY: And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
JERRY: And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
JERRY: And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
JERRY: And it's about nothing?
JERRY: And it's probably a union thing.
JERRY: And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
JERRY: And milk.
JERRY: And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?
JERRY: And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
JERRY: And she said Yes?
JERRY: And she wants to break up with you..
JERRY: And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
JERRY: And shopping.
JERRY: And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
JERRY: And that guy is your new boss?
JERRY: And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
JERRY: And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
JERRY: and that's why you're going out with him
JERRY: And the guy never knows?
JERRY: And the indigent.
JERRY: And the other.
JERRY: And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
JERRY: And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
JERRY: And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
JERRY: And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
JERRY: And then there's Maude.
JERRY: And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
JERRY: And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
JERRY: And then?
JERRY: And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
JERRY: And there's David Steinberg.
JERRY: And there's so much more to go.
JERRY: And they said they can do it?
JERRY: And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
JERRY: and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
JERRY: And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
JERRY: And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
JERRY: And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
JERRY: And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
JERRY: And what did she do?
JERRY: And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
JERRY: And what do I say about you?
JERRY: And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
JERRY: And what is that?
JERRY: And what's gonna happen?
JERRY: And what's with people getting sick?
JERRY: And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
JERRY: And what, hope for a crash?
JERRY: And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
JERRY: And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, Dont go there. - Someones gotta take a stand!
JERRY: And where were you?
JERRY: And who else is on the show?
JERRY: And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
JERRY: And who makes the switch?
JERRY: And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
JERRY: And yet he continues to live.
JERRY: And you are it!
JERRY: And you are?
JERRY: And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
JERRY: And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
JERRY: And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
JERRY: And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
JERRY: And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
JERRY: And you don't...
JERRY: And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
JERRY: And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
JERRY: And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
JERRY: And you misinterpret this how?
JERRY: And you want to be my latex salesman.
JERRY: And you waved it away.
JERRY: And you were integral.
JERRY: And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
JERRY: And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
JERRY: And you're the model for this perfume?
JERRY: And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
JERRY: And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
JERRY: And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
JERRY: And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
JERRY: And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
JERRY: And?
JERRY: And?
JERRY: Anklets?
JERRY: Another babka?
JERRY: Another Café Latte?
JERRY: Another ending?
JERRY: Another friend?
JERRY: Another one?
JERRY: Another shot, I want another shot.
JERRY: Another time? What other time?
JERRY: Answering machine. Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
JERRY: Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' Where's your jock strap? Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
JERRY: Any Hennigans around here?
JERRY: Any luck?
JERRY: Any messages?
JERRY: Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
JERRY: Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
JERRY: Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
JERRY: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
JERRY: Anything else?
JERRY: Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
JERRY: Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
JERRY: Anything's *possible*...
JERRY: Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
JERRY: Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers.
JERRY: Anyway, I don't need your help.
JERRY: Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
JERRY: Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
JERRY: Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
JERRY: Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
JERRY: Anyway, I'm ready to go.
JERRY: Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
JERRY: Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
JERRY: Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
JERRY: Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
JERRY: Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
JERRY: Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
JERRY: Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
JERRY: Anywhere in the city?
JERRY: Anywhere.
JERRY: Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.
JERRY: Ar-moire.
JERRY: Are my nostrils getting bigger?
JERRY: Are saying you're banning me from the store?
JERRY: Are there golf clubs in the back?
JERRY: Are these seats unbelievable or what?
JERRY: Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
JERRY: Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
JERRY: Are we about throw here Newman?
JERRY: Are we finished?
JERRY: Are we going out?
JERRY: Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
JERRY: Are you all right?
JERRY: Are you all right?
JERRY: Are you alright?
JERRY: Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
JERRY: Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
JERRY: Are you going to say anything?
JERRY: Are you gonna say it again?
JERRY: Are you insane? Give 'em to me.
JERRY: Are you just screwing with me?
JERRY: Are you kidding?
JERRY: Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
JERRY: Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
JERRY: Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
JERRY: Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
JERRY: Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye.
JERRY: Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
JERRY: Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
JERRY: Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
JERRY: Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
JERRY: Are you O.K. in here?
JERRY: Are you okay?
JERRY: Are you okay?
JERRY: Are you okay? Did he bite ya?
JERRY: Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
JERRY: Are you ready?
JERRY: Are you saying...
JERRY: Are you sensing anything right now?
JERRY: Are you serious, what about Elaine?
JERRY: Are you serious?
JERRY: Are you serious?
JERRY: Are you serious?
JERRY: Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
JERRY: Are you sure you can't stay longer?
JERRY: Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
JERRY: Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
JERRY: Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. Remember Ricie Appel?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
JERRY: Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
JERRY: Are you that desperate?
JERRY: Are you through?
JERRY: Are you?
JERRY: Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. What ever happened to Bob? Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face. Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived.
JERRY: Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
JERRY: Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
JERRY: Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
JERRY: Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
JERRY: Arent you gonna take it?
JERRY: Around eleven.
JERRY: Art Cor...
JERRY: Artsy?
JERRY: As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?
JERRY: As a mater of fact, he did.
JERRY: As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protégé of my own.
JERRY: As good as it gets.
JERRY: As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
JERRY: As soon as is humanly possible.
JERRY: As we all do.
JERRY: As you see it?
JERRY: Ask George to go with you.
JERRY: Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
JERRY: Ask him to change it.
JERRY: Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
JERRY: Ask Newman.
JERRY: Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
JERRY: Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
JERRY: Assman!
JERRY: Assman?
JERRY: At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
JERRY: At least it was just the handle!
JERRY: At least it's show business..
JERRY: At least you'll be talking.
JERRY: At me?
JERRY: At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
JERRY: At the zoo?
JERRY: At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
JERRY: At your apartment?
JERRY: Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
JERRY: Atomic Sub? Why are you eating there?
JERRY: Au revoir, Le George.
JERRY: Aub, ah, Gipple?
JERRY: Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
JERRY: Audrey.
JERRY: Audrey?
JERRY: Australia?
JERRY: Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
JERRY: Aw right.
JERRY: Aw!
JERRY: Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what, a couple of minutes.
JERRY: Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
JERRY: Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
JERRY: Aw, come on there now.
JERRY: Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
JERRY: Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
JERRY: Aw, looks just like you.
JERRY: Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
JERRY: Aw, that's kind of sweet.
JERRY: Aw, these are really strong glasses.
JERRY: Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
JERRY: Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
JERRY: Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
JERRY: Aw, what are you doin' to me?
JERRY: Aw, you know people.
JERRY: Aw.
JERRY: Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
JERRY: Awe... That's nice!
JERRY: Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
JERRY: Awright, fine. You wanna see it?
JERRY: Awright, let's eat already.
JERRY: Awright, let's see. How about Mug? Mug Costanza, that's original. Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
JERRY: Awright.
JERRY: Aww!
JERRY: Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
JERRY: Aww...
JERRY: Aye, aye.
JERRY: Aye......
JERRY: B.L.?
JERRY: Babu must be back.
JERRY: Babu!
JERRY: Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
JERRY: Babu, may I say something?
JERRY: Babu, you're Pakistani, right?
JERRY: Babu? Babu... Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
JERRY: Babu? I'll be right back.
JERRY: Babu?!
JERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left
JERRY: Back on the rack.
JERRY: Back on? What was it doing off?
JERRY: Back to my place. That's right.
JERRY: Back together?
JERRY: Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
JERRY: Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
JERRY: Bad rap?
JERRY: Bad situation.
JERRY: Bad.
JERRY: Bad? Very bad?
JERRY: Bagels?
JERRY: Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
JERRY: Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
JERRY: Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
JERRY: Bania.
JERRY: Bania?
JERRY: Bania?
JERRY: Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
JERRY: Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.
JERRY: Bazooka Joe.
JERRY: Be careful Kramer.
JERRY: Be careful.
JERRY: Be right back.
JERRY: Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
JERRY: Beats me.
JERRY: Beautiful!
JERRY: Beautiful!
JERRY: Beautiful!
JERRY: Beautiful.
JERRY: Beautiful.
JERRY: Beautiful.
JERRY: Beautiful.
JERRY: Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
JERRY: Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
JERRY: Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
JERRY: Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
JERRY: Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
JERRY: Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
JERRY: Because he's my butler!
JERRY: Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me
JERRY: Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
JERRY: Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
JERRY: Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
JERRY: Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
JERRY: Because I gave it to you.
JERRY: Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
JERRY: Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
JERRY: Because I know who has it.
JERRY: Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
JERRY: Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
JERRY: Because I was standing here, that?s why.
JERRY: Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
JERRY: Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
JERRY: Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
JERRY: Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
JERRY: Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
JERRY: Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
JERRY: Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid, stupid...
JERRY: Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
JERRY: Because its complicated. Theres some tension there.
JERRY: Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
JERRY: Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
JERRY: Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
JERRY: Because of Ted Danson.
JERRY: Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
JERRY: Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine!
JERRY: Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
JERRY: Because she's my wife! Yeh?
JERRY: Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
JERRY: Because that's your thing!
JERRY: Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
JERRY: Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
JERRY: Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
JERRY: Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
JERRY: Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
JERRY: Because this is very good.
JERRY: Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
JERRY: Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
JERRY: Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
JERRY: Because you didnt have a job?
JERRY: Because you know we used to go out.
JERRY: Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
JERRY: Because you threw it out.
JERRY: Because you were too busy stealing a book.
JERRY: Because you're a woman!
JERRY: Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
JERRY: Because, HE'S my directions.
JERRY: Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
JERRY: Bedroom.
JERRY: Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
JERRY: Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
JERRY: Being really clean and happy?
JERRY: Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
JERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.
JERRY: Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. Oo that little tail really turns me on.
JERRY: Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
JERRY: Below the equator?
JERRY: Bender.
JERRY: Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
JERRY: Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
JERRY: Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
JERRY: Beth and Arnie broke up.
JERRY: Better.
JERRY: Between Poland and Morgan?
JERRY: Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
JERRY: Biff?
JERRY: Big accomplishment.
JERRY: Big head That's almost a compliment.
JERRY: Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
JERRY: Big matzoh ball.
JERRY: Big surprise.
JERRY: Binaca?
JERRY: Birds?
JERRY: Birds?
JERRY: Bit you?!
JERRY: Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
JERRY: Bless you.
JERRY: Bless you.
JERRY: Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
JERRY: Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
JERRY: Bob Cobb.
JERRY: Bob!
JERRY: Bob.
JERRY: Bob. Oh, Bob.
JERRY: Bomb threat.
JERRY: Bon voyage, Lainey!
JERRY: Bonkers?
JERRY: Boo!
JERRY: Boogeyman.
JERRY: Booze is not a religion.
JERRY: Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
JERRY: Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
JERRY: Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
JERRY: Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
JERRY: Boy shes sexy isnt she?
JERRY: Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
JERRY: Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
JERRY: Boy, am I glad to see you.
JERRY: Boy, do you smell something?
JERRY: Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. So, when do you move into the apartment?
JERRY: Boy, he took it hard.
JERRY: Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
JERRY: Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
JERRY: Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
JERRY: Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
JERRY: Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
JERRY: Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
JERRY: Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
JERRY: Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
JERRY: Boy, I'm surprised. I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
JERRY: Boy, I've never seen you like this.
JERRY: Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
JERRY: Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
JERRY: Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
JERRY: Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
JERRY: Boy, its a good thing we came.
JERRY: Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
JERRY: Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.
JERRY: Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
JERRY: Boy, that is some kick.
JERRY: Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
JERRY: Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
JERRY: Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
JERRY: Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
JERRY: Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
JERRY: Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
JERRY: Boy, those capes are really coming back.
JERRY: Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
JERRY: Boy, you are really hungry.
JERRY: Boy, you can really talk some trash. I guess that's better than eating it.
JERRY: Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
JERRY: Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
JERRY: Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen Girlie Brown would be very proud of you.
JERRY: Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
JERRY: Boy, your really packing it all in.
JERRY: Boy.
JERRY: Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
JERRY: Boy...
JERRY: Boy... I dont know.
JERRY: Boys, boys.
JERRY: Boys, boys.
JERRY: Boysenberry, Huckleberry ...
JERRY: Brave new world, alright.
JERRY: Breakfast?
JERRY: Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
JERRY: Bridget!
JERRY: Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
JERRY: Broke even.
JERRY: Broke even.
JERRY: Buddy?
JERRY: Buh bye.
JERRY: Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
JERRY: Busy We've made a lot of friends, shared a lot of laughs, often at the expense of others, and slept with.. well who's counting?
JERRY: But -
JERRY: But an 85?
JERRY: But are you still master of your domain?
JERRY: But gymnastics is not for everybody.
JERRY: But he was squinting.
JERRY: But he's an old man, Elaine.
JERRY: But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
JERRY: But I changed my mind..
JERRY: But I could do that and the music.
JERRY: But I don't know if this is gonna work.
JERRY: But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
JERRY: But I don't want any sweet action.
JERRY: But I don't want to.
JERRY: But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
JERRY: But I might.
JERRY: But I need the home bed advantage.
JERRY: But I never walk you home.
JERRY: But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
JERRY: But I thought things were going great.
JERRY: But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
JERRY: But I was promised this slot.
JERRY: But I went to the funeral.
JERRY: But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
JERRY: But I'm not a disturbance!
JERRY: But I'm so good.
JERRY: But I, I didn't, I--
JERRY: But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
JERRY: But if you go back with me, then I'm not.
JERRY: But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
JERRY: But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
JERRY: But is this an emergency?
JERRY: But it was in the cylinder!
JERRY: But it's a big complex.
JERRY: But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
JERRY: But it's your bodega.
JERRY: But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
JERRY: But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
JERRY: But Kramer--
JERRY: But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
JERRY: But not anymore.
JERRY: But not here.
JERRY: But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
JERRY: But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
JERRY: But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on.
JERRY: But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
JERRY: But someone is waiting for me!
JERRY: But that guy has my jacket.
JERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.
JERRY: But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
JERRY: But that's not what she thinks.
JERRY: But that's you.
JERRY: But that's your routine.
JERRY: But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
JERRY: But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
JERRY: But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
JERRY: But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
JERRY: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
JERRY: But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
JERRY: But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
JERRY: But the whole car smells.
JERRY: But then anyone can just look in and see you.
JERRY: But then I found out about the skin cancer.
JERRY: But then we would have missed the whole thing.
JERRY: But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!

JERRY: But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
JERRY: But theyre talking about nothing.
JERRY: But this is what you've always wanted.
JERRY: But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
JERRY: But wait a minute...
JERRY: But we already knew that.
JERRY: But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
JERRY: But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
JERRY: But we're in towels.
JERRY: But what about the messages?
JERRY: But why?
JERRY: But why? Why McDowell?
JERRY: But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
JERRY: But you can never keep a secret.
JERRY: But you can't act.

JERRY: But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
JERRY: But you like your Joel Rifkin.
JERRY: But you made it through the day before.
JERRY: But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
JERRY: But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
JERRY: But you said, it can be very serious.
JERRY: But you took a nap in it.
JERRY: But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
JERRY: But you were supposed to get me a refund.
JERRY: But you yada yada'd over the best part.
JERRY: But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
JERRY: But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
JERRY: But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
JERRY: But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
JERRY: But, I don't want to be a pirate!
JERRY: But, I never...
JERRY: But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
JERRY: But, when did I do that?
JERRY: But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
JERRY: But, you know, what if, you know?
JERRY: But, your father's not bald.
JERRY: But...
JERRY: But...
JERRY: But....
JERRY: But?
JERRY: Buyer beware.
JERRY: By Elaine Benes?
JERRY: By flying half way around the world?
JERRY: By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
JERRY: By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
JERRY: By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
JERRY: By the way, did you see this?
JERRY: By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
JERRY: By the way, just for the record -
JERRY: By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
JERRY: By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.

JERRY: Can I ask you a question?
JERRY: Can I get anybody anything?
JERRY: Can I have a club soda? Goin' on tonight?
JERRY: Can I have a piece of that?

JERRY: Can I help you?
JERRY: Can I just get it opened first?

JERRY: Can we just go in already?
JERRY: Can we just go?
JERRY: Can you believe her?
JERRY: Can you believe I did that?
JERRY: Can you believe it?!
JERRY: Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
JERRY: Can you believe that?
JERRY: Can you blame her?
JERRY: Can you bring my mail then?
JERRY: Can you conduct your business elsewhere?

JERRY: Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.

JERRY: Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
JERRY: Cant get it.
JERRY: Cant you talk to your boss?
JERRY: Carl, I think.
JERRY: Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
JERRY: Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
JERRY: Casus belli.
JERRY: Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
JERRY: Catnap?
JERRY: Caught you? Doing what?
JERRY: Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
JERRY: Cause I hit a whopper last week!

JERRY: Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
JERRY: Certainly are.
JERRY: Certainly not.
JERRY: Change? Yes, I think that's a super idea.
JERRY: Charity?!? That's apalling.
JERRY: Cheapness is not a sense.
JERRY: Check the pile.
JERRY: Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie Cinderfella. I got 'em at an auction.
JERRY: Check.
JERRY: Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?
JERRY: Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
JERRY: Chicken?
JERRY: China really?
JERRY: Cigars!
JERRY: Cindy.
JERRY: Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
JERRY: Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
JERRY: Clean as a whistle.
JERRY: Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
JERRY: Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
JERRY: Clever.
JERRY: Coach to India - The only way to go.
JERRY: Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
JERRY: Coffee?
JERRY: Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?

JERRY: Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
JERRY: Do you wanna fight?
JERRY: Do you wanna flip a coin?
JERRY: Do you want box or hanger?
JERRY: Do you want it?
JERRY: Do you want me to break up with you?
JERRY: Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
JERRY: Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
JERRY: Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
JERRY: Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.
JERRY: Does it ever bother you that this organization-
JERRY: Does it matter?
JERRY: Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
JERRY: Does it smell like the East River?
JERRY: Does she hate cigarettes?
JERRY: Does she know?
JERRY: Does that thing work?
JERRY: Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
JERRY: Does what?
JERRY: Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
JERRY: Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
JERRY: Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
JERRY: Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
JERRY: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
JERRY: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
JERRY: Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
JERRY: Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?
JERRY: Dollars?
JERRY: Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
JERRY: Don't ask me!
JERRY: Don't ask.
JERRY: Don't be alarmed.
JERRY: Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
JERRY: Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
JERRY: Don't blow this.
JERRY: Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
JERRY: Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
JERRY: Don't get smart.
JERRY: Don't get up, please, allow me.
JERRY: Don't go a-knockin'.
JERRY: Don't look at him.
JERRY: Don't mention it to anybody.
JERRY: Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
JERRY: Don't push me.
JERRY: Don't say that.
JERRY: Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
JERRY: Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
JERRY: Don't spell.
JERRY: Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
JERRY: Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
JERRY: Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. There's your food.
JERRY: Don't worry, I'll get you out.
JERRY: Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
JERRY: Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
JERRY: Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
JERRY: Don't worry.
JERRY: Don't you ever talk about her like that!
JERRY: Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
JERRY: Don't you hire people to do that?
JERRY: Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!
JERRY: Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
JERRY: Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
JERRY: Don't you need a little... help?
JERRY: Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
JERRY: Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
JERRY: Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk, he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling.
JERRY: Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
JERRY: Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
JERRY: Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
JERRY: Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
JERRY: Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
JERRY: Don't you think she could tell?
JERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
JERRY: Done what?
JERRY: Done.
JERRY: Done.
JERRY: Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
JERRY: Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
JERRY: Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
JERRY: Dont get up.
JERRY: Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
JERRY: Dont worry. Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...
JERRY: Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
JERRY: Doofus?
JERRY: Double good-bye!
JERRY: Double zero?
JERRY: Down here?
JERRY: Drakes Coffee Cake
JERRY: Drawer.
JERRY: Drop dead?
JERRY: Drop one. . . . left!
JERRY: Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
JERRY: Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
JERRY: Duck, Kramer! Duck!
JERRY: Dude!
JERRY: Duncan Meyers!
JERRY: Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
JERRY: Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
JERRY: Dylan Murphy.
JERRY: Easy big fella.
JERRY: Easy?
JERRY: Eat something! Babu...
JERRY: Echh
JERRY: Eckman? I thought he was doing time?
JERRY: Edmund Fitzgerald.
JERRY: Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
JERRY: Eehh.
JERRY: Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
JERRY: Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?
JERRY: Eh, it went okay.
JERRY: Eh, people, people are talking.
JERRY: Eh, show biz...
JERRY: Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer.
JERRY: Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
JERRY: Eh, what?
JERRY: Eh.
JERRY: Eh.
JERRY: Eh.
JERRY: Eh. You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying my wife. Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - my wife this, my wife that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
JERRY: Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
JERRY: Ehh, I dunno..
JERRY: Ehh, nobody listens.
JERRY: Eighteen-fifties?
JERRY: Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
JERRY: Either way.
JERRY: Elaaaiinne...
JERRY: Elaine
JERRY: Elaine ... look! A twenty!
JERRY: Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.
JERRY: Elaine danced?
JERRY: Elaine got a new number because she died.
JERRY: Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
JERRY: Elaine huh?.. She's completely..
JERRY: Elaine is having a houseguest. She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
JERRY: Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
JERRY: Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
JERRY: Elaine was... in a rush.
JERRY: Elaine would never borrow that much money! Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!
JERRY: Elaine you're missing the whole point.
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: Elaine! No! No!
JERRY: Elaine's writing a Murphy Brown?
JERRY: Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
JERRY: Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
JERRY: Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
JERRY: Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
JERRY: Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said Too bad he's gay.
JERRY: Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
JERRY: Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
JERRY: Elaine, Elaine... Yeah?
JERRY: Elaine, George
JERRY: Elaine, have you been talking to her?
JERRY: Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
JERRY: Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
JERRY: Elaine, he doesn't need-
JERRY: Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!
JERRY: Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
JERRY: Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
JERRY: Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
JERRY: Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
JERRY: Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
JERRY: Elaine, I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces.
JERRY: Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
JERRY: Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
JERRY: Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!?
JERRY: Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
JERRY: Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a Murphy Brown. You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
JERRY: Elaine, let the man make his soup!
JERRY: Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
JERRY: Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... Godfather.
JERRY: Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
JERRY: Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
JERRY: Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
JERRY: Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
JERRY: Elaine, stop it.
JERRY: Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
JERRY: Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
JERRY: Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
JERRY: Elaine, this is Corinne.
JERRY: Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing here?
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
JERRY: Elaine, what do you think?
JERRY: Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
JERRY: Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
JERRY: Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
JERRY: Elaine, would you marry me?
JERRY: Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
JERRY: Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
JERRY: Elaine, you're among friends.
JERRY: Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
JERRY: Elaine.
JERRY: Elaine.
JERRY: Elaine.
JERRY: Elaine. ELAINE!
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
JERRY: Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
JERRY: Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
JERRY: Elaine? What does she have to - Oh no...
JERRY: Elaine?!
JERRY: Elaine?!
JERRY: Elainell kill me.
JERRY: Elaines thing? How you gonna get in?
JERRY: Eleven dollars for what?
JERRY: Enjoyed yourself.
JERRY: Entertainment Tonight's on.
JERRY: Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
JERRY: Errh.
JERRY: Especially that big kid up in the front. How old is he? Hello?
JERRY: Euhh...Elaine....
JERRY: Evelyn, this is Elaine.
JERRY: Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
JERRY: Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
JERRY: Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
JERRY: Even more reasonable.
JERRY: Eventually a little shot of penicillin
JERRY: Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
JERRY: Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
JERRY: Everybody's got them.
JERRY: Everybody's moving to Seattle.
JERRY: Everybodys ripping me off!
JERRY: Everyday is my birthday.
JERRY: Everyday.
JERRY: everyone knows the first break-up never takes. Yeah?
JERRY: Everything all right?
JERRY: Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
JERRY: Everything.
JERRY: Everything.
JERRY: Everything?
JERRY: Everything?
JERRY: Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. Oh, is he good? Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best. They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher. And then there's always that, Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me. Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs.
JERRY: Exactly
JERRY: Exactly.
JERRY: Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
JERRY: Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
JERRY: Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
JERRY: Excellent. So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
JERRY: Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
JERRY: Except that it's not Putty.
JERRY: Except the store's in Delaware.
JERRY: Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
JERRY: Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
JERRY: Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
JERRY: Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
JERRY: Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
JERRY: Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
JERRY: Excuse me, Mother?
JERRY: Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
JERRY: Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
JERRY: Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
JERRY: Excuse me, what?
JERRY: Excuse me.
JERRY: Excuse me.
JERRY: Excuse me. Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
JERRY: Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
JERRY: Excuse me. Excuse me? Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you oh well, what are you deaf?
JERRY: Excuse me. Mister Benes?
JERRY: Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
JERRY: Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Excuse me?!
JERRY: Expect a call.
JERRY: Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
JERRY: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
JERRY: Extra teeth. I love that look.
JERRY: Ey, ey!
JERRY: Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
JERRY: Face to face.
JERRY: Faked 'em all.
JERRY: Family?
JERRY: Famous Original Ray's?
JERRY: Fancy meeting you here!
JERRY: Fantastic.
JERRY: Fantastic.
JERRY: Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
JERRY: Farfel?
JERRY: Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
JERRY: Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
JERRY: fault. Do you smell smoke?
JERRY: Faux pas.
JERRY: Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
JERRY: Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
JERRY: Feel good.
JERRY: Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
JERRY: Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
JERRY: Few do.
JERRY: Few hundred grand?
JERRY: Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
JERRY: Fifty dollars.
JERRY: Fifty dollars?
JERRY: Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
JERRY: Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
JERRY: Filks nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.
JERRY: Filthy pigs.
JERRY: Finders fee? It was on the lot!
JERRY: Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
JERRY: Fine, if I'm off yours.
JERRY: Fine, if I'm off yours.
JERRY: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
JERRY: Fine, Mrs. Costanza. Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
JERRY: Fine.
JERRY: Fine.
JERRY: Fine.
JERRY: Fine.
JERRY: Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..
JERRY: Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
JERRY: Fine. Go.
JERRY: Fine. Well.
JERRY: Fine..
JERRY: Fine...
JERRY: Fire drill, can you believe that?
JERRY: Fire engines?
JERRY: Fire station?
JERRY: First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
JERRY: First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
JERRY: First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, Didn't you see my signal? Look at that fender! ..Then you'd see a real fight.
JERRY: First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
JERRY: First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
JERRY: First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
JERRY: First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
JERRY: First we ride the cyclone.
JERRY: First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
JERRY: First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
JERRY: First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
JERRY: Five minutes.
JERRY: Five o'clock.
JERRY: Five, ten minutes.
JERRY: Fix a screen door in Queens.
JERRY: Fleckman?
JERRY: Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
JERRY: Flowers?
JERRY: Flowing?
JERRY: Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
JERRY: Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land. I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you.
JERRY: Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
JERRY: For a date?
JERRY: For both of us.
JERRY: For crying out loud, He's Superman. Fulton? Fulton?
JERRY: For either one of us..
JERRY: For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
JERRY: For fun.
JERRY: For how long?
JERRY: For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
JERRY: For some time... It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
JERRY: For the apartment.
JERRY: For what dinner?
JERRY: For what?
JERRY: For what?
JERRY: For what?
JERRY: Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug.
JERRY: Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
JERRY: Forget it.
JERRY: Forget it.
JERRY: Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
JERRY: Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP&lt; 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
JERRY: Forget the bench.
JERRY: Forget the sports jacket.
JERRY: Four hundred a month.
JERRY: Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
JERRY: Four in the morning?!
JERRY: Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
JERRY: Fourteen thousand.
JERRY: Fourteen years down the drain.
JERRY: Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
JERRY: Franco?
JERRY: Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?
JERRY: Frankie... come on out of there.
JERRY: Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
JERRY: Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
JERRY: Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
JERRY: Fred, do you know Elaine?
JERRY: Fred?
JERRY: Friday night.
JERRY: Friday night? Nothin', ... now.
JERRY: Friday?
JERRY: Friend!
JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.
JERRY: From that woman at NBC?
JERRY: From what?
JERRY: From what?
JERRY: From your mother.
JERRY: Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
JERRY: Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
JERRY: Fungicide. Fungus?
JERRY: Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
JERRY: Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
JERRY: Game over.
JERRY: Game, set and match, huh Milos?
JERRY: Game?
JERRY: Gary?
JERRY: Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
JERRY: Gay?
JERRY: Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
JERRY: Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
JERRY: Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
JERRY: Gee, I never thought of that.
JERRY: Gee, I'm really sorry.
JERRY: Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
JERRY: Geoffrey who?
JERRY: George
JERRY: George - could I have a word?
JERRY: George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
JERRY: George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
JERRY: George Costanza is your mentor?
JERRY: George Costanza...
JERRY: George got him fired. He squealed on him.
JERRY: George has become a hand model.
JERRY: George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
JERRY: George I'm telling ya..
JERRY: George is already in there.
JERRY: George is dating a convict.
JERRY: George is pickin' us up at the airport.
JERRY: George is taking it.
JERRY: George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
JERRY: George NO!!
JERRY: George Peppard has been dead for years.
JERRY: George says hi.
JERRY: George this is Mickey.
JERRY: George too.
JERRY: George used up all my guest passes already.
JERRY: George was right. Didn't take you long.
JERRY: George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
JERRY: George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
JERRY: George!
JERRY: George!
JERRY: George!
JERRY: George! Can we focus on the car, here?
JERRY: George's father.
JERRY: George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say, kookie talk.
JERRY: George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
JERRY: George, big news; I'm getting married!!
JERRY: George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
JERRY: George, did you get that chair yet?
JERRY: George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
JERRY: George, does your father speak Korean?
JERRY: George, George!

JERRY: George, give them to me, I want these keys. I don't want to get physical!
JERRY: George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
JERRY: George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
JERRY: George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
JERRY: George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
JERRY: George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
JERRY: George, I'm sorry.
JERRY: George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
JERRY: George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
JERRY: George, is this funny?
JERRY: George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? No...do we know where 170 is? No...do we know where 134 is? No. Aha, ok. He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
JERRY: George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
JERRY: George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
JERRY: George, Marla.
JERRY: George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
JERRY: George, Stacey.
JERRY: George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
JERRY: George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
JERRY: George, the man wept.
JERRY: George, the phone's free.
JERRY: George, this is Nina.
JERRY: George, we need to talk.
JERRY: George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
JERRY: George, what's the matter with you?
JERRY: George, whats going on?!
JERRY: George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
JERRY: George, who is that woman in the stripes?
JERRY: George, would you help me, please?
JERRY: George, you need a medical doctor.
JERRY: George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
JERRY: George, you're thinking too much.
JERRY: George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
JERRY: George-
JERRY: George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.

JERRY: Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
JERRY: Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?

JERRY: How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
JERRY: How ya doin'?
JERRY: How ya doin'?
JERRY: How ya doing?
JERRY: How ya doing? Can't talk? Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? I like that. So how's life without tonsils? What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. What are you doing?
JERRY: How you doing?
JERRY: How you doing?
JERRY: How you feeling?
JERRY: How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
JERRY: How you gonna get me up there?
JERRY: How you gonna get out of *that* one?
JERRY: How you gonna hold it on there?
JERRY: How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
JERRY: How'd it go?
JERRY: How'd it taste?
JERRY: How'd that happen?
JERRY: How'd you do on the IQ test?!
JERRY: How'd you expect to get out of here?
JERRY: How'd you find out?
JERRY: How'd you get yours?
JERRY: How're things going?
JERRY: How's George?
JERRY: How's it coming?
JERRY: How's it doing?
JERRY: How's it going?
JERRY: How's it going?

JERRY: How's your confidence level?
JERRY: How's your family history?
JERRY: Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?

JERRY: Hows he doing?
JERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
JERRY: Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...
JERRY: Hug is definitely good.
JERRY: HUGE pop-in guy!
JERRY: huh huh
JERRY: Huh, wa?
JERRY: Huh.
JERRY: Huh.
JERRY: Huh. Alright.
JERRY: Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
JERRY: Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
JERRY: Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it: They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Huh?

JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Huh? How you feeling?
JERRY: Huh? Huh?
JERRY: Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, That's not a bad idea.
JERRY: Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
JERRY: Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
JERRY: Hum... ok, what else you got?
JERRY: humm...
JERRY: Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, This is good, who is this? I like this person. You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!
JERRY: hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey
JERRY: Hurry up George! Step on it!
JERRY: I *just* learned that.
JERRY: I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
JERRY: I - I don't get it.
JERRY: I accept.
JERRY: I actually met her a few weeks ago, but...
JERRY: I admit it. I don't watch it.
JERRY: I agreed to wear this?!
JERRY: I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
JERRY: I am a little freaked out!
JERRY: I am challenging.
JERRY: I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
JERRY: I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
JERRY: I am not an anti-dentite!
JERRY: I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
JERRY: I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
JERRY: I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
JERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
JERRY: I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
JERRY: I am. It was the world's first.
JERRY: I am...the master packer.
JERRY: I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
JERRY: I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
JERRY: I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, Oh This is so good. What's in it? The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
JERRY: I believe he is wearing a cape.
JERRY: I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
JERRY: I believe this belongs to you.
JERRY: I believe we're not...
JERRY: I believe you.
JERRY: I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
JERRY: I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
JERRY: I better not.
JERRY: I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
JERRY: I bought him some kishka.
JERRY: I bought it for you. It's yours.
JERRY: I bought you a Cadillac. Here you go.
JERRY: I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
JERRY: I called, what should I do? We really appreciate this.
JERRY: I came to pick you up.
JERRY: I can ball park it.
JERRY: I can do that.
JERRY: I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
JERRY: I can get it.
JERRY: I can manage.
JERRY: I can see that! What happened?
JERRY: I can see that.
JERRY: I can see that. What's it for?
JERRY: I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
JERRY: I can start right away.
JERRY: I can tell you what to do.
JERRY: I can tell you what to think.
JERRY: I can't ... I can't
JERRY: I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
JERRY: I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
JERRY: I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
JERRY: I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
JERRY: I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
JERRY: I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
JERRY: I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
JERRY: I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
JERRY: I can't believe it.
JERRY: I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
JERRY: I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
JERRY: I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
JERRY: I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
JERRY: I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
JERRY: I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
JERRY: I can't believe this.
JERRY: I can't believe this.
JERRY: I can't believe this. A 5-19?
JERRY: I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
JERRY: I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
JERRY: I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
JERRY: I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
JERRY: I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
JERRY: I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
JERRY: I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
JERRY: I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. Get this one: I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest.
JERRY: I can't believe your a friend of mine.
JERRY: I can't buy mangos and plantains?
JERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
JERRY: I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
JERRY: I can't do it. Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
JERRY: I can't do this.
JERRY: I can't do those things.
JERRY: I can't eat this.
JERRY: I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
JERRY: I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
JERRY: I can't give details.
JERRY: I can't go if you're mad.
JERRY: I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
JERRY: I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
JERRY: I can't go.
JERRY: I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
JERRY: I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
JERRY: I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there.
JERRY: I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
JERRY: I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
JERRY: I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
JERRY: I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
JERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
JERRY: I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
JERRY: I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
JERRY: I can't take it.
JERRY: I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
JERRY: I can't wait.
JERRY: I can't wear these!
JERRY: I can't, I can't take it.
JERRY: I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
JERRY: I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
JERRY: I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
JERRY: I can't.
JERRY: I can't.
JERRY: I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
JERRY: I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
JERRY: I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
JERRY: I can't. Nobody's even listening.
JERRY: I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
JERRY: I can?
JERRY: I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that Breakfast at Tiffany's thing.
JERRY: I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
JERRY: I cannot take it!
JERRY: I cant believe I do.
JERRY: I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
JERRY: I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
JERRY: I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
JERRY: I cant believe Im gonna do this.
JERRY: I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
JERRY: I cant believe what Im hearing.
JERRY: I cant believe youre here.
JERRY: I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
JERRY: I cant find the receipt.
JERRY: I cant get involved in this.
JERRY: I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
JERRY: I cant. I got to meet Clare.
JERRY: I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
JERRY: I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
JERRY: I cant. What if he wakes up?
JERRY: I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it.
JERRY: I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
JERRY: I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
JERRY: I could tell.
JERRY: I could, but I choose not to.
JERRY: I couldn't
JERRY: I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a magical world of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
JERRY: I couldn't do it without you.
JERRY: I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
JERRY: I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
JERRY: I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
JERRY: I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
JERRY: I did it for you.
JERRY: I did not bail out on you.
JERRY: I did not cheat.
JERRY: I did not!
JERRY: I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
JERRY: I did something stupid.
JERRY: I did.
JERRY: I did.
JERRY: I did.
JERRY: I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. Six points? Its up six points!
JERRY: I didn't actually want to rent it.
JERRY: I didn't care.
JERRY: I didn't do anything.
JERRY: I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
JERRY: I didn't do it!
JERRY: I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
JERRY: I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
JERRY: I didn't even use the ticket!
JERRY: I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
JERRY: I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
JERRY: I didn't hear anything.
JERRY: I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
JERRY: I didn't know any of this.
JERRY: I didn't know he wasn't invited.
JERRY: I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
JERRY: I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
JERRY: I didn't know she was married.
JERRY: I didn't know she would laugh.
JERRY: I didn't know that...
JERRY: I didn't know you had a hopper.
JERRY: I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
JERRY: I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
JERRY: I didn't know.
JERRY: I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
JERRY: I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
JERRY: I didn't notice the voice.
JERRY: I didn't ruin your business.
JERRY: I didn't say anything.
JERRY: I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
JERRY: I didn't see anything.
JERRY: I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
JERRY: I didn't think so.
JERRY: I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
JERRY: I didn't--
JERRY: I didn, t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
JERRY: I didnt bring anything.
JERRY: I didnt even know the woman.
JERRY: I didnt even think to look.
JERRY: I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?
JERRY: I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
JERRY: I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
JERRY: I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
JERRY: I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
JERRY: I do a wash.
JERRY: I do favors.
JERRY: I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
JERRY: I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
JERRY: I do.
JERRY: I do.
JERRY: I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her.
JERRY: I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
JERRY: I don't believe this! Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
JERRY: I don't believe this.
JERRY: I don't believe this.
JERRY: I don't blame you. I blame myself.
JERRY: I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
JERRY: I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
JERRY: I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
JERRY: I don't care, why are you telling me this?
JERRY: I don't care.
JERRY: I don't care.
JERRY: I don't care.
JERRY: I don't doubt it.
JERRY: I don't either.
JERRY: I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
JERRY: I don't even know if I remember the number.
JERRY: I don't even know what to say.
JERRY: I don't even know what you're talking about.
JERRY: I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
JERRY: I don't even think you could do it.
JERRY: I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
JERRY: I don't feel like eating.
JERRY: I don't feel so good.
JERRY: I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
JERRY: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
JERRY: I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? Just asking.
JERRY: I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
JERRY: I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
JERRY: I don't have a paper though.
JERRY: I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
JERRY: I don't have a washcloth.
JERRY: I don't have any change. You've got any change?
JERRY: I don't have any material!
JERRY: I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
JERRY: I don't have it!
JERRY: I don't have it. You want half my omelet?
JERRY: I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
JERRY: I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
JERRY: I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! Yeah?!
JERRY: I don't know
JERRY: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
JERRY: I don't know about defraying.
JERRY: I don't know about sixty.
JERRY: I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
JERRY: I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
JERRY: I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
JERRY: I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
JERRY: I don't know anything about that.
JERRY: I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow.
JERRY: I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
JERRY: I don't know him. I know who he is.
JERRY: I don't know how I feel about it.
JERRY: I don't know how long this is gonna last.
JERRY: I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,
JERRY: I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
JERRY: I don't know how you do it.
JERRY: I don't know if he's mad.
JERRY: I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
JERRY: I don't know if they have land guys.
JERRY: I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
JERRY: I don't know what I was thinking.
JERRY: I don't know what that could be.
JERRY: I don't know what that means.
JERRY: I don't know what this is.
JERRY: I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
JERRY: I don't know what to do.
JERRY: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
JERRY: I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
JERRY: I don't know what you should do with it.
JERRY: I don't know what's happening to me.
JERRY: I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
JERRY: I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
JERRY: I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
JERRY: I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
JERRY: I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
JERRY: I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
JERRY: I don't know!
JERRY: I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
JERRY: I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
JERRY: I don't know! It just popped out.
JERRY: I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
JERRY: I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
JERRY: I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
JERRY: I don't know, but we don't have much time.
JERRY: I don't know, but you better keep it up.
JERRY: I don't know, but you don't have it.
JERRY: I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
JERRY: I don't know, do you have a--
JERRY: I don't know, George.
JERRY: I don't know, Hi.
JERRY: I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
JERRY: I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
JERRY: I don't know, I just see you guys together.
JERRY: I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
JERRY: I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
JERRY: I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
JERRY: I don't know, it's ten dollars.
JERRY: I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
JERRY: I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
JERRY: I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
JERRY: I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
JERRY: I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
JERRY: I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
JERRY: I don't know, regular human time?
JERRY: I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
JERRY: I don't know, she just sits there.
JERRY: I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.
JERRY: I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
JERRY: I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
JERRY: I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
JERRY: I don't know, this?
JERRY: I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'
JERRY: I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
JERRY: I don't know, whatever they do.
JERRY: I don't know, Who keeps track of Hellos.
JERRY: I don't know, you know, what if...?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.  5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley...
JERRY: I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
JERRY: I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
JERRY: I don't know. Blind date?
JERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
JERRY: I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
JERRY: I don't know. It must be love.
JERRY: I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe.
JERRY: I don't know. Nothing.?
JERRY: I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
JERRY: I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
JERRY: I don't know. That's like asking Where's Waldo?
JERRY: I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that?
JERRY: I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
JERRY: I don't know. They're, backed up.
JERRY: I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it?
JERRY: I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
JERRY: I don't know. What if I get caught?
JERRY: I don't know. Where have you been?
JERRY: I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
JERRY: I don't know. Why?
JERRY: I don't know...
JERRY: I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
JERRY: I don't know? Consommé or something.
JERRY: I don't like him.
JERRY: I don't like pesto.
JERRY: I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
JERRY: I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
JERRY: I don't mind the cemetery.
JERRY: I don't mind the Mayans.
JERRY: I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
JERRY: I don't need a personal trainer. all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
JERRY: I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
JERRY: I don't need the money.
JERRY: I don't read in the bathroom.
JERRY: I don't really have enough room.
JERRY: I don't recall you drinking Café Latte.
JERRY: I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
JERRY: I don't see why not.
JERRY: I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
JERRY: I don't smell anything.
JERRY: I don't think I am.
JERRY: I don't think I can be that nice.
JERRY: I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
JERRY: I don't think I'm hungry:
JERRY: I don't think it's that bad.
JERRY: I don't think my attitude has changed.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!
JERRY: I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
JERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?
JERRY: I don't think so...
JERRY: I don't think that's it.
JERRY: I don't think that's Salman.
JERRY: I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
JERRY: I don't think the network will go for it.
JERRY: I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
JERRY: I don't think you are.
JERRY: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
JERRY: I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
JERRY: I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
JERRY: I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
JERRY: I don't understand this..
JERRY: I don't understand what the big deal is.
JERRY: I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
JERRY: I don't understand why we have to eat now.
JERRY: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
JERRY: I don't understand. Is there a problem? I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
JERRY: I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
JERRY: I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
JERRY: I don't wanna be a 32.
JERRY: I don't wanna be Switzerland.
JERRY: I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
JERRY: I don't wanna use your car.
JERRY: I don't want a van.
JERRY: I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
JERRY: I don't want any!
JERRY: I DON'T WANT IT ....
JERRY: I don't want it that way.
JERRY: I don't want it!!
JERRY: I don't want it.
JERRY: I don't want it..
JERRY: I don't want one.
JERRY: I don't want the coat.
JERRY: I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
JERRY: I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
JERRY: I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
JERRY: I don't want to stop her!
JERRY: I don't want to talk about it!
JERRY: I don't want to trade.
JERRY: I don't want to.
JERRY: I don't want to.
JERRY: I don't want you to call him.
JERRY: I don't write skits.
JERRY: I don't.
JERRY: I don't...I dunno.
JERRY: I don't...think so.
JERRY: I dont believe this.
JERRY: I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
JERRY: I dont care about it.
JERRY: I dont care. Im sleeping next door.
JERRY: I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
JERRY: I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
JERRY: I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
JERRY: I dont have any plants.
JERRY: I dont know how Im going to tell him.
JERRY: I dont know how this happened.
JERRY: I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
JERRY: I dont know what to do.
JERRY: I dont know, I don't feel so good.
JERRY: I dont know.
JERRY: I dont know.
JERRY: I dont know.
JERRY: I dont know. He said hed call back.
JERRY: I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
JERRY: I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
JERRY: I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
JERRY: I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
JERRY: I dont need any more.
JERRY: I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
JERRY: I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
JERRY: I dont see architecture comin from you.
JERRY: I dont think so.
JERRY: I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
JERRY: I dont think you did anything wrong.
JERRY: I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?
JERRY: I dont want cantaloupe now.
JERRY: I dunno
JERRY: I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
JERRY: I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot.
JERRY: I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
JERRY: I dunno, I'm gonna ask Shelley, but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
JERRY: I dunno, it was an impulse.
JERRY: I dunno, maybe...
JERRY: I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
JERRY: I dunno. Hard to say.
JERRY: I dunno. He's so strange.'
JERRY: I dunno. Hey.
JERRY: I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
JERRY: I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
JERRY: I dunno. Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
JERRY: I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
JERRY: I dunno...
JERRY: I dunno...
JERRY: I dunno... *Alright*, I forgive you...
JERRY: I feel terrible. I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
JERRY: I find the whole thing very embarrassing.
JERRY: I follow. So what are you gonna do?
JERRY: I forgot about the video.
JERRY: I forgot my toothbrush.
JERRY: I forgot to make my bed.
JERRY: I forgot to take it off.
JERRY: I forgot.
JERRY: I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
JERRY: I gave a look?
JERRY: I gave a look?
JERRY: I gave you a hundred dollars?!
JERRY: I gave you a taste. What do you want?
JERRY: I gave your ticket to Horneck.
JERRY: I get it.
JERRY: I get peeved.
JERRY: I got a 31 waist, mister!
JERRY: I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
JERRY: I got a date with Nikki.
JERRY: I got a date with that girl, Lena.
JERRY: I got a date!
JERRY: I got a date. C'mon, please.
JERRY: I got a haircut.
JERRY: I got an idea.
JERRY: I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
JERRY: I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
JERRY: I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
JERRY: I got isobutane-20.
JERRY: I got it! We give the keys to Elaine.
JERRY: I got my health.
JERRY: I got no problem with that.
JERRY: I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.
JERRY: I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out: The Report. They give you: Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
JERRY: I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
JERRY: I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
JERRY: I got the call...!
JERRY: I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
JERRY: I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
JERRY: I got you an apartment in the building.
JERRY: I got your message, so I came straight from Atlantic City.
JERRY: I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
JERRY: I got: You enter, you go Hi, and I go, Hello. Now.. we need something here..
JERRY: I gotta do some research here.
JERRY: I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
JERRY: I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
JERRY: I gotta get out of this cab...
JERRY: I gotta get to the airport.
JERRY: I gotta go meet Pam.
JERRY: I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
JERRY: I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
JERRY: I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
JERRY: I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
JERRY: I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
JERRY: I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
JERRY: I guess he graduated.
JERRY: I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I?
JERRY: I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
JERRY: I guess I would.
JERRY: I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
JERRY: I guess Im coming. I mean...
JERRY: I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
JERRY: I guess that's all right.
JERRY: I guess that's true...
JERRY: I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? Let's get out of here George.
JERRY: I guess they leave that up to the general population.
JERRY: I guess we'll never know.
JERRY: I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
JERRY: I guess.
JERRY: I guess.
JERRY: I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
JERRY: I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
JERRY: I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
JERRY: I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
JERRY: I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
JERRY: I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me. But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
JERRY: I had a statue!
JERRY: I had a statue! What should I do?
JERRY: I had a very interesting lunch with
JERRY: I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
JERRY: I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
JERRY: I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
JERRY: I had to do it.
JERRY: I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
JERRY: I had to.
JERRY: I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a
JERRY: I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... Or is that you?
JERRY: I hate the counter.
JERRY: I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
JERRY: I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the
JERRY: I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life. Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, I had a heart attack this big ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! Brrhht.. and it's gone!
JERRY: I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
JERRY: I have absolutely no idea.
JERRY: I have aloe!
JERRY: I have an idea. We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
JERRY: I have an instinct for these things.
JERRY: I have fleas.
JERRY: I have money. I make money.
JERRY: I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks. Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back.
JERRY: I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
JERRY: I have no idea.
JERRY: I have no idea.
JERRY: I have no idea.
JERRY: I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.
JERRY: I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
JERRY: I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
JERRY: I have some idea.
JERRY: I have some questions of my own.
JERRY: I have to do what?
JERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
JERRY: I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
JERRY: I have to go over to my grandmother's.
JERRY: I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
JERRY: I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
JERRY: I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
JERRY: I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.
JERRY: I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
JERRY: I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
JERRY: I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
JERRY: I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
JERRY: I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity--
JERRY: I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
JERRY: I haven't been out yet.
JERRY: I hear it's ah beautiful there.
JERRY: I hear things.
JERRY: I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the It's me on the phone today.
JERRY: I hear you're going out with David Putty.TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce: you get impeached and you're not even the president!
JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
JERRY: I heard something.
JERRY: I heard something. Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on Murphy Brown!
JERRY: I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
JERRY: I heard those doves were really incredible.
JERRY: I heard you say something, there.
JERRY: I hired her from a service!
JERRY: I hope so.
JERRY: I invented that.
JERRY: I just a ssumed, ...
JERRY: I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
JERRY: I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
JERRY: I just don't understand the raisinettes.
JERRY: I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
JERRY: I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
JERRY: I just met her, she's incredible.
JERRY: I just said that.
JERRY: I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
JERRY: I just wanna call the police!
JERRY: I just want a, touch em a little.
JERRY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
JERRY: I just wanted you to scare him.
JERRY: I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
JERRY: I killed.
JERRY: I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
JERRY: I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
JERRY: I knew it! I'm not crazy.
JERRY: I knew it.
JERRY: I knew this would happen.
JERRY: I know a little.
JERRY: I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
JERRY: I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
JERRY: I know enough not to get on them.
JERRY: I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
JERRY: I know Finland. Theyre neutral.
JERRY: I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
JERRY: I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
JERRY: I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
JERRY: I know isn't that something?
JERRY: I know it is!
JERRY: I know it was stupid.
JERRY: I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
JERRY: I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. Nothing!
JERRY: I know it.
JERRY: I know look at this
JERRY: I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
JERRY: I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
JERRY: I know that, Kramer.
JERRY: I know the list...
JERRY: I know the point.
JERRY: I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
JERRY: I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
JERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
JERRY: I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
JERRY: I know what you mean.
JERRY: I know you will.
JERRY: I know!
JERRY: I know!
JERRY: I know!
JERRY: I know! What are you doin' here?!?
JERRY: I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
JERRY: I know, but I'm distracted now.
JERRY: I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
JERRY: I know, but...
JERRY: I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
JERRY: I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
JERRY: I know, George told me.
JERRY: I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
JERRY: I know, I feel bad about that...
JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
JERRY: I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
JERRY: I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
JERRY: I know, I know...
JERRY: I know, I know... Well, you know.
JERRY: I know, I should've asked her.
JERRY: I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
JERRY: I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
JERRY: I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
JERRY: I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
JERRY: I know. I was just...
JERRY: I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, check, and late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
JERRY: I know. It's like X-ray vision.
JERRY: I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
JERRY: I know. Neighbors.
JERRY: I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
JERRY: I know. Pretty steep.
JERRY: I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
JERRY: I know. They're not even related.
JERRY: I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
JERRY: I know.. How about dessert?
JERRY: I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
JERRY: I like it tucked.
JERRY: I like it.
JERRY: I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
JERRY: I like sneakers.
JERRY: I like that thing in your hair there.
JERRY: I like that. What do you think, George?
JERRY: I like the button fly.
JERRY: I like the way you think.
JERRY: I like to use my own material.
JERRY: I like your nails, that is a great color.
JERRY: I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
JERRY: I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
JERRY: I live in New York. What the hell happened?
JERRY: I loaned the car to George.
JERRY: I long for you?
JERRY: I look about the same.
JERRY: I love a parade!
JERRY: I love crampbark.
JERRY: I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!
JERRY: I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
JERRY: I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
JERRY: I love the Drake!
JERRY: I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
JERRY: I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
JERRY: I love Yoo Hoo.
JERRY: I love you, Costanza.
JERRY: I love you, George. Come here.
JERRY: I Love you.
JERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
JERRY: I may have mentioned it.
JERRY: I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
JERRY: I mean all that stuff is so small.. ) stupid..
JERRY: I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
JERRY: I mean I have many gay friends...
JERRY: I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
JERRY: I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
JERRY: I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
JERRY: I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it.
JERRY: I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
JERRY: I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
JERRY: I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
JERRY: I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
JERRY: I mean the whole thing, it's just...
JERRY: I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
JERRY: I mean, ... if you want to.
JERRY: I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
JERRY: I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need the clown in his title, as clown? Bozo, the clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
JERRY: I mean, come on. No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
JERRY: I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
JERRY: I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
JERRY: I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
JERRY: I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, That hand should not be on my leg. But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, Would you mind?!
JERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
JERRY: I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
JERRY: I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
JERRY: I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
JERRY: I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
JERRY: I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
JERRY: I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
JERRY: I mean, let's say we did.
JERRY: I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
JERRY: I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
JERRY: I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
JERRY: I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
JERRY: I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
JERRY: I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
JERRY: I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
JERRY: I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
JERRY: I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
JERRY: I mean, you love Susan, right?
JERRY: I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
JERRY: I met her on an elevator.
JERRY: I met her one time...
JERRY: I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
JERRY: I might need you to get me a soda.
JERRY: I missed you.
JERRY: I must have iron rich blood.
JERRY: I need a can of balls.
JERRY: I need a miracle.
JERRY: I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
JERRY: I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
JERRY: I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
JERRY: I never heard her say hi.
JERRY: I never really wanted the pen.
JERRY: I never remember you with a girl.
JERRY: I never said I'd do that.
JERRY: I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
JERRY: I never should have made up those rules.
JERRY: I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
JERRY: I never shoulda told you.
JERRY: I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
JERRY: I never told you his name.
JERRY: I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
JERRY: I noticed she's big on the phrase yada yada.
JERRY: I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
JERRY: I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
JERRY: I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...
JERRY: I only have a twenty.
JERRY: I ordered in. It's still effort.
JERRY: I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
JERRY: I read it in Ann Landers.
JERRY: I read.
JERRY: I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
JERRY: I really don't eat it.
JERRY: I really don't feel like seeing her.
JERRY: I really don't see the difference.
JERRY: I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
JERRY: I really dont need to look.
JERRY: I really have to go to the bathroom.
JERRY: I really think you're making too much of this.
JERRY: I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
JERRY: I really wanna have fun.
JERRY: I really wanna...
JERRY: I reckon.
JERRY: I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his,...
JERRY: I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again.
JERRY: I remember that night.
JERRY: I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
JERRY: I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
JERRY: I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
JERRY: I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
JERRY: I said I was sorry.
JERRY: I said luss. Im at a luss.
JERRY: I said no!
JERRY: I said pull over by the stop sign.
JERRY: I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
JERRY: I said, and more.
JERRY: I said, boy am I ugly.
JERRY: I said, How come no one's killed her? Probably shouldn't have said anything,
JERRY: I said, never mind.
JERRY: I saw it.
JERRY: I saw one once that could do sign language.
JERRY: I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
JERRY: I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
JERRY: I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
JERRY: I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. The New Yorker is stealing my ideas. ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
JERRY: I see you there Ramon.
JERRY: I see you, Newman! I see you!
JERRY: I see. She's looking.
JERRY: I sense something is afoot.
JERRY: I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
JERRY: I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
JERRY: I should have some reason.
JERRY: I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
JERRY: I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
JERRY: I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
JERRY: I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
JERRY: I sound funny?
JERRY: I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
JERRY: I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
JERRY: I still don't have to go.
JERRY: I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
JERRY: I still don't know what that means.
JERRY: I still don't know what the idea is.
JERRY: I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
JERRY: I strained my neck last night.
JERRY: I suppose if it was on the protégé's way to the mentor, they might.
JERRY: I suppose you think your bombable.
JERRY: I suppose.
JERRY: I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
JERRY: I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
JERRY: I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
JERRY: I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
JERRY: I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
JERRY: I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
JERRY: I think Chemical Bank.
JERRY: I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
JERRY: I think he knew.
JERRY: I think he's black.
JERRY: I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
JERRY: I think he's the same age as the father.
JERRY: I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
JERRY: I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
JERRY: I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y.
JERRY: I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
JERRY: I think I heard her say something about a bench.
JERRY: I think I may have made a big mistake.
JERRY: I think I offended the wake-up guy...!
JERRY: I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
JERRY: I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
JERRY: I think I was tucked.!
JERRY: I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
JERRY: I think I'm in love.
JERRY: I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
JERRY: I think I've seen that look.
JERRY: I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
JERRY: I think it has something to do with me.
JERRY: I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
JERRY: I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
JERRY: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
JERRY: I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
JERRY: I think it's off the wagon.
JERRY: I think it's tamber.
JERRY: I think it's the stench of death.
JERRY: I think Ill take out the garbage.
JERRY: I think Ive played there.
JERRY: I think she meant me, but.
JERRY: I think SHE saw it coming.
JERRY: I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
JERRY: I think so.
JERRY: I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
JERRY: I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
JERRY: I think that would be a very nice gesture.
JERRY: I think that's a 5-19.
JERRY: I think that's a little extreme.
JERRY: I think that's a what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
JERRY: I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery.
JERRY: I think that's for the best.
JERRY: I think that's it. Sweet fancy Moses!
JERRY: I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
JERRY: I think the candy comes out over there.
JERRY: I think the damage is probably already done. All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
JERRY: I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
JERRY: I think the phone is ringing.
JERRY: I think theres a mental hospital near here.
JERRY: I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
JERRY: I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
JERRY: I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
JERRY: I think we might have one left in the stock room.
JERRY: I think we should separate here actually.
JERRY: I think we're still a man short.
JERRY: I think we've worked out a system.
JERRY: I think what he's trying to say is, get the bouilla-base. ALLI
JERRY: I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
JERRY: I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
JERRY: I think you got it.
JERRY: I think you know my policy.
JERRY: I think you may have something there.
JERRY: I think you need more sleep.
JERRY: I think you said driver.
JERRY: I think you scared me straight.
JERRY: I think you'll get it out.
JERRY: I think you're getting a ticket.
JERRY: I think you're wrong.
JERRY: I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
JERRY: I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
JERRY: I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
JERRY: I thought I smelled lilac.
JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
JERRY: I thought it sounded kind of cool.
JERRY: I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
JERRY: I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
JERRY: I thought it was open to the public.
JERRY: I thought it was over there.
JERRY: I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
JERRY: I thought naked is good.
JERRY: I thought so.
JERRY: I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
JERRY: I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
JERRY: I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
JERRY: I thought there were two outs.
JERRY: I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
JERRY: I thought they smelled pretty nice.
JERRY: I thought they wanted to settle.
JERRY: I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
JERRY: I thought we were going out.
JERRY: I thought we were going to the movies?
JERRY: I thought we were talking about me.
JERRY: I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
JERRY: I thought you didn't want the doormat.
JERRY: I thought you just said she doesn't know??
JERRY: I thought you might.
JERRY: I thought you said it was imminent.
JERRY: I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
JERRY: I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
JERRY: I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
JERRY: I thought you said you were a good driver!
JERRY: I thought you said... ridicurous.
JERRY: I thought you saw that already...
JERRY: I thought you stopped talking??
JERRY: I thought you were going out with Celia?
JERRY: I thought you were gonna watch a video.
JERRY: I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
JERRY: I thought you were on strike?
JERRY: I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
JERRY: I thought you'd like that.
JERRY: I thought you'd like that.
JERRY: I thought your mother's paying for it.
JERRY: I thought your parents were outta town?
JERRY: I thought youd be upset.
JERRY: I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
JERRY: I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
JERRY: I told her about the contest.
JERRY: I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
JERRY: I told it. Ya?
JERRY: I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
JERRY: I told ya. How good is this?
JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
JERRY: I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
JERRY: I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
JERRY: I told you not to come.
JERRY: I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
JERRY: I told you to cut it out.
JERRY: I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
JERRY: I told you to take it.
JERRY: I told you we shouldn't do it.
JERRY: I told you when I met her.
JERRY: I told you!
JERRY: I told you, forget it.
JERRY: I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
JERRY: I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
JERRY: I told you.
JERRY: I told you.
JERRY: I took two bites, how am I finished? Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? Bite?
JERRY: I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
JERRY: I tried my best!
JERRY: I tried putting her hands there but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
JERRY: I tried to do that.
JERRY: I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
JERRY: I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em.
JERRY: I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
JERRY: I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
JERRY: I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. Hello.
JERRY: I try.
JERRY: I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
JERRY: I understand .
JERRY: I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
JERRY: I understand.
JERRY: I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
JERRY: I used it up
JERRY: I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
JERRY: I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
JERRY: I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
JERRY: I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
JERRY: I wanna see what's happening.
JERRY: I want everyone out!
JERRY: I want that number!
JERRY: I want that picture.
JERRY: I want that rye lady.
JERRY: I want that rye, lady!
JERRY: I want the antidote, pimple popper!
JERRY: I want the massage!
JERRY: I want this baby fully loaded. Well, how soon can you get it there? Oh, that's terrific. Okay, thanks, bye.
JERRY: I want to but I can't.
JERRY: I want to!
JERRY: I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.
JERRY: I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
JERRY: I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
JERRY: I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed.
JERRY: I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
JERRY: I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
JERRY: I was an idiot for listening to you!
JERRY: I was arrested for urinating.
JERRY: I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
JERRY: I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!
JERRY: I was blowing on the coffee.
JERRY: I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
JERRY: I was going to say, Being a good host.
JERRY: I was got to be 55.
JERRY: I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
JERRY: I was hoping you'd offer. Yeah?
JERRY: I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
JERRY: I was just flipping it, it's mine.
JERRY: I was just in the bathroom.
JERRY: I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
JERRY: I was kidding when I said that!
JERRY: I was kind of um making out.
JERRY: I was listening!
JERRY: I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
JERRY: I was lying, give it to me!
JERRY: I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
JERRY: I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
JERRY: I was out in the snow last night.
JERRY: I was out.
JERRY: I was ready to get jiggy with it.
JERRY: I was saying 'baby' way before George!
JERRY: I was saying the same thing.
JERRY: I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
JERRY: I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
JERRY: I was talking to him.
JERRY: I was terrible.
JERRY: I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
JERRY: I was trying to be.
JERRY: I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
JERRY: I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
JERRY: I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
JERRY: I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
JERRY: I went out with you.
JERRY: I will - don't worry. In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
JERRY: I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.
JERRY: I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
JERRY: I will, I just walked in the door.
JERRY: I will.
JERRY: I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there?
JERRY: I wish I could, but, we're friends..
JERRY: I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
JERRY: I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
JERRY: I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
JERRY: I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
JERRY: I wonder what ever happened to her.
JERRY: I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
JERRY: I wonder.
JERRY: I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! They look ridiculous!
JERRY: I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
JERRY: I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
JERRY: I would know if I had a blender.
JERRY: I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
JERRY: I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
JERRY: I would lose that.
JERRY: I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
JERRY: I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
JERRY: I would think.
JERRY: I woulda taken you to the airport.
JERRY: I wouldn't know where to start.
JERRY: I wouldn't think so.
JERRY: I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it.
JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
JERRY: I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
JERRY: I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
JERRY: I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
JERRY: I'd be happy to.
JERRY: I'd be very interested in something like that.
JERRY: I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
JERRY: I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?
JERRY: I'd like to be.
JERRY: I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
JERRY: I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
JERRY: I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
JERRY: I'd rather not talk about it.
JERRY: I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
JERRY: I'll be back on Monday.
JERRY: I'll be here.
JERRY: I'll be right back.
JERRY: I'll call an ambulance.
JERRY: I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America!
JERRY: I'll call George!
JERRY: I'll call you later.
JERRY: I'll dig.

JERRY: I'll pass.
JERRY: I'll pay for it.
JERRY: I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
JERRY: I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
JERRY: I'll remember that.
JERRY: I'll say.
JERRY: I'll see you later.
JERRY: I'll see you later.
JERRY: I'll see you tonight.
JERRY: I'll take fastidious.
JERRY: I'll take the first class.
JERRY: I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for, sir?
JERRY: I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.

JERRY: I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
JERRY: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
JERRY: I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
JERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
JERRY: I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.

JERRY: I'm I'm a comedian.
JERRY: I'm in show business.
JERRY: I'm in the book and I have a machine.
JERRY: I'm in the middle of a story.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: I'm just glad it's outta here. What's that?
JERRY: I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
JERRY: I'm just not getting any hot water.
JERRY: I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
JERRY: I'm kinda in the middle of something.
JERRY: I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
JERRY: I'm locking the vault. What?
JERRY: I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
JERRY: I'm looking for a crested blazer
JERRY: I'm looking forward to it.
JERRY: I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
JERRY: I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
JERRY: I'm nauseous.
JERRY: I'm Nelson!
JERRY: I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.
JERRY: I'm not a foodie. I don't, Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty. Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.. What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
JERRY: I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
JERRY: I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here.
JERRY: I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. Hi, how ya doin.'
JERRY: I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
JERRY: I'm not carrying a purse.
JERRY: I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!
JERRY: I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
JERRY: I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!
JERRY: I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
JERRY: I'm not engaged.
JERRY: I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
JERRY: I'm not gay.
JERRY: I'm not getting illegal cable!
JERRY: I'm not giving you her number.
JERRY: I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me: C'mon Jerry, go along, go along...
JERRY: I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
JERRY: I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
JERRY: I'm not going to defile her!
JERRY: I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
JERRY: I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
JERRY: I'm not happy.
JERRY: I'm not having money problems.
JERRY: I'm not having this conversation.
JERRY: I'm not in the mood.
JERRY: I'm not joking!
JERRY: I'm not kidding.
JERRY: I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
JERRY: I'm not lying.
JERRY: I'm not married!
JERRY: I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
JERRY: I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
JERRY: I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
JERRY: I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
JERRY: I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
JERRY: I'm not sending him to your house.
JERRY: I'm not sending you the bill.
JERRY: I'm not sick. You - you said much sicker things than me.
JERRY: I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk.
JERRY: I'm not sure, but I think she was nice.
JERRY: I'm not sure. What was that dish he said he had...?
JERRY: I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
JERRY: I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
JERRY: I'm not taking anyone's side.
JERRY: I'm not talking about upside down. I'm talking about waking him up!
JERRY: I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
JERRY: I'm not touching that thing.
JERRY: I'm not wearing the fur.
JERRY: I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
JERRY: I'm not yella.
JERRY: I'm nuts about her.
JERRY: I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
JERRY: I'm off the project.
JERRY: I'm on next, right?
JERRY: I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
JERRY: I'm out.
JERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
JERRY: I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
JERRY: I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
JERRY: I'm ready to talk.
JERRY: I'm really sorry.
JERRY: I'm right here.
JERRY: I'm right here. You're late.
JERRY: I'm saying get the hell outta there! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
JERRY: I'm Seinfeld!
JERRY: I'm serious about it.
JERRY: I'm serious!
JERRY: I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
JERRY: I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
JERRY: I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train
JERRY: I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
JERRY: I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
JERRY: I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
JERRY: I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
JERRY: I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
JERRY: I'm sorry too.
JERRY: I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
JERRY: I'm sorry, I..
JERRY: I'm sorry, Kramer.
JERRY: I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
JERRY: I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...
JERRY: I'm sorry, really.
JERRY: I'm sorry, uh,
JERRY: I'm sorry, uh-
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
JERRY: I'm sorry. I'm soured.
JERRY: I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
JERRY: I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
JERRY: I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
JERRY: I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
JERRY: I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
JERRY: I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
JERRY: I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
JERRY: I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
JERRY: I'm sure it didn't move.
JERRY: I'm sure it won't.
JERRY: I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
JERRY: I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
JERRY: I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
JERRY: I'm swamped.
JERRY: I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
JERRY: I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
JERRY: I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
JERRY: I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
JERRY: I'm telling and you can't stop me!
JERRY: I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
JERRY: I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
JERRY: I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
JERRY: I'm telling you, she's good looking.
JERRY: I'm telling you, the guy took.....
JERRY: I'm telling you.
JERRY: I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
JERRY: I'm there for you.
JERRY: I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
JERRY: I'm too tired.
JERRY: I'm trying.
JERRY: I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
JERRY: I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
JERRY: I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
JERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?
JERRY: I'm very sorry.
JERRY: I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
JERRY: I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. So, you want a protein shake, or something?
JERRY: I'm with you.
JERRY: I'm working in Atlantic City.
JERRY: I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, Do you want the check? No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
JERRY: I've always wanted to do that...
JERRY: I've been defaced!
JERRY: I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
JERRY: I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
JERRY: I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
JERRY: I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? A real dermatologist.
JERRY: I've gained eight.
JERRY: I've got a black eye.
JERRY: I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
JERRY: I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
JERRY: I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
JERRY: I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
JERRY: I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
JERRY: I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
JERRY: I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
JERRY: I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
JERRY: I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
JERRY: I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
JERRY: I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!
JERRY: I've never been called breathtaking either.
JERRY: I've never done it before.
JERRY: I've never fixed anybody up.
JERRY: I've never had a job.
JERRY: I've never had a really good pickle.
JERRY: I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
JERRY: I've seen her in your building.
JERRY: I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
JERRY: I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
JERRY: I, dont see it happening.
JERRY: I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
JERRY: I, I had no idea.
JERRY: I, I love that George.
JERRY: I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
JERRY: I, I'm sorry.
JERRY: I, really can't say.
JERRY: I, uh...well...
JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
JERRY: I-
JERRY: I- no, I dont want to go.
JERRY: I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright
JERRY: I-I'll tell 'em
JERRY: I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
JERRY: I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
JERRY: I... don't... know...
JERRY: I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
JERRY: I...am not taking it.
JERRY: I..I didn't say that.
JERRY: Ideally.
JERRY: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
JERRY: If he does.
JERRY: If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
JERRY: If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
JERRY: If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
JERRY: If he's black.
JERRY: If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
JERRY: If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
JERRY: If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
JERRY: If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
JERRY: If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?
JERRY: If I told you, you woulda given it away.
JERRY: If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
JERRY: If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
JERRY: If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
JERRY: If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
JERRY: If it was real, they would never let it out of the country. No baldness, it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
JERRY: If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
JERRY: If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'
JERRY: If not now, when?
JERRY: If not now, when?
JERRY: If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
JERRY: If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
JERRY: If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
JERRY: If that's Rushdie, they're real.
JERRY: If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? Oh, he was kind of quiet. I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes: You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore.
JERRY: If they like each other.
JERRY: If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
JERRY: If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
JERRY: If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
JERRY: If you can.
JERRY: If you don't believe me, ask her.
JERRY: If you feed him, he'll never leave.
JERRY: If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
JERRY: If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
JERRY: If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
JERRY: If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
JERRY: If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no
JERRY: If you need more time, you should have more time.
JERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
JERRY: If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
JERRY: If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
JERRY: If you'll excuse me.
JERRY: Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
JERRY: Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
JERRY: Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
JERRY: Imagine, spelling Mom with two Os.
JERRY: Imagine, us narks?
JERRY: Impossible, right?
JERRY: In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
JERRY: In a manner of speaking.
JERRY: In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
JERRY: In case of what?
JERRY: In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
JERRY: In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
JERRY: In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
JERRY: In his dreams.
JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
JERRY: In other words, a normal relationship.
JERRY: In the back, on your right.
JERRY: In the freezer.
JERRY: In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
JERRY: In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
JERRY: In two days.
JERRY: In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
JERRY: In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
JERRY: In your way.
JERRY: Indeed.
JERRY: Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
JERRY: Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
JERRY: Inside out! Great.
JERRY: Inside the van?
JERRY: Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
JERRY: Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
JERRY: Intervention.
JERRY: Into the patient, *literally*!
JERRY: Investigation?
JERRY: Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
JERRY: Irish money?
JERRY: Irish, Scottish, whats the difference, lassie?
JERRY: Irked?
JERRY: is beating the bushes-
JERRY: Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going: Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going.
JERRY: Is getting married!
JERRY: Is he from the future?
JERRY: Is he gay?
JERRY: Is he okay?
JERRY: Is he on the plane now?
JERRY: Is he smart?
JERRY: Is he still in town?
JERRY: Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
JERRY: Is it a good one?
JERRY: Is it a lot of cream soups?
JERRY: Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
JERRY: Is it better than mine?
JERRY: Is it Famous Ray's?
JERRY: Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
JERRY: Is it me?
JERRY: Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
JERRY: Is it padded?
JERRY: Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
JERRY: Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
JERRY: Is it something I said?
JERRY: Is my toaster oven on there?
JERRY: Is not.
JERRY: Is not.
JERRY: Is she nice?
JERRY: Is she OK?
JERRY: Is she?
JERRY: Is that a fact?
JERRY: Is that a sectional?
JERRY: Is that a thick marble?
JERRY: Is that bothering you?
JERRY: Is that Burt Reynolds?
JERRY: Is that from my gift certificate?
JERRY: Is that guy still there?
JERRY: Is that it?
JERRY: Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. Thats it. Done!
JERRY: Is that Joe Davola?
JERRY: Is that like the end of the world or something?
JERRY: Is that my paper?
JERRY: Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
JERRY: Is that right?
JERRY: Is that right?
JERRY: Is that right?
JERRY: Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: is that so?
JERRY: Is that something you want to do?
JERRY: Is that still from the cats?
JERRY: Is that the end of it?
JERRY: Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
JERRY: Is that uh, other apartment still available?
JERRY: Is that what she said?
JERRY: Is that what the doctor said?
JERRY: Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
JERRY: Is that your chicken making all that noise?
JERRY: Is the flounder here yet?
JERRY: Is there a box spring?
JERRY: Is there a box spring?
JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
JERRY: Is there, something I can help you with?
JERRY: Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
JERRY: Is this a problem?
JERRY: Is this a repeat?
JERRY: Is this about me?
JERRY: Is this even a road?
JERRY: Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?
JERRY: Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
JERRY: Is this my stereo?
JERRY: Is this okay? Can I do this?
JERRY: Is this really necessary?
JERRY: Is this the proper venue?
JERRY: Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
JERRY: Is this yours or the roommate's?
JERRY: Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
JERRY: Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
JERRY: Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
JERRY: Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
JERRY: Isn't he, Elaine?
JERRY: Isn't it common knowledge?
JERRY: Isn't it Myanmar now?
JERRY: Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
JERRY: Isn't that against the law?
JERRY: Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
JERRY: Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
JERRY: Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
JERRY: Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
JERRY: Isn't there a deductible?
JERRY: It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
JERRY: It appears that way.
JERRY: it can't be
JERRY: It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
JERRY: It can't be worse than this.
JERRY: It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
JERRY: It certainly has.
JERRY: It completely turned her off.
JERRY: It did?
JERRY: It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for: Avast ye matey - what the hell does that mean?! 20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon! - there's no comeback for that!
JERRY: It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
JERRY: It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
JERRY: It does other things!
JERRY: It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
JERRY: It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
JERRY: It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
JERRY: It doesn't work like that.
JERRY: It doesn't?
JERRY: It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity.
JERRY: It has nothing to do with her sister.
JERRY: It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
JERRY: It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
JERRY: It is a good idea, Elaine.
JERRY: It is a tad askew.
JERRY: It is exciting.
JERRY: It is kind of silly.
JERRY: It is not!
JERRY: It is so my business!
JERRY: It is unbelievable.
JERRY: It is! Give me that back.
JERRY: It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
JERRY: It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
JERRY: It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
JERRY: It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
JERRY: It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
JERRY: It means he's lying.
JERRY: It means: Death to tyrants.
JERRY: It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
JERRY: It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
JERRY: It should resolve of its own volition.
JERRY: It smells like the beach.
JERRY: It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
JERRY: It sounds like an excellent idea.
JERRY: It still smells!
JERRY: It stinks.
JERRY: It sure is.
JERRY: It tastes like dirt.
JERRY: It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
JERRY: It was a *joke*...
JERRY: It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
JERRY: It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
JERRY: It was a bisque.
JERRY: It was a gift.
JERRY: It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
JERRY: It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse ha's. You know those?
JERRY: It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
JERRY: It was a mistake.
JERRY: It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
JERRY: It was a scratch.
JERRY: It was a so-so sorry.
JERRY: It was a wonderful reading.
JERRY: It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
JERRY: It was an accident.
JERRY: It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
JERRY: It was embarrassing to me.
JERRY: It was funny!
JERRY: It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
JERRY: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
JERRY: It was just a couple of blocks.
JERRY: It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
JERRY: It was life and death.
JERRY: It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
JERRY: It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
JERRY: It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. It was GEORGE!
JERRY: It was not!
JERRY: It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
JERRY: It was sold out!
JERRY: It was stupid of me.
JERRY: It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
JERRY: It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
JERRY: It was wonderful.
JERRY: It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.
JERRY: It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
JERRY: It would be nice to care about someone.
JERRY: It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
JERRY: It's 10:30 in the morning?
JERRY: It's 5:30 in the morning!
JERRY: It's a cigar store Indian. Read the card.
JERRY: It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
JERRY: It's a haaazy mystery.
JERRY: It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
JERRY: It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
JERRY: It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
JERRY: It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
JERRY: It's a little ...
JERRY: It's a little short.
JERRY: It's a lotta gum!
JERRY: It's a mammal.
JERRY: It's a monkey, Kramer!
JERRY: It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
JERRY: It's a must lie situation.
JERRY: It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.
JERRY: It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
JERRY: It's a pig at a complain department.
JERRY: It's a schnoz.
JERRY: It's a simple question...
JERRY: It's a tad dainty.
JERRY: It's a tell. You gotta tell.
JERRY: It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants.
JERRY: It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
JERRY: It's a very complicated area.
JERRY: It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
JERRY: It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
JERRY: It's against the law.
JERRY: It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
JERRY: It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
JERRY: It's all taken care of.
JERRY: It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
JERRY: It's almost a week.
JERRY: It's alright, I want you to have it.
JERRY: It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
JERRY: It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
JERRY: It's an ambulance. I don't know but he's unconscious.
JERRY: It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad. But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, I refuse to put any thought into this at all. Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
JERRY: It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
JERRY: It's apples and oranges..
JERRY: It's at the jeweler.
JERRY: it's battle conditions
JERRY: It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
JERRY: It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
JERRY: It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
JERRY: It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
JERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.
JERRY: It's been years!
JERRY: It's better than Dondi.
JERRY: It's brown.
JERRY: It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
JERRY: It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
JERRY: IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
JERRY: It's Dolores.
JERRY: It's early.
JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
JERRY: It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
JERRY: It's European.
JERRY: It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
JERRY: It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
JERRY: It's funny!
JERRY: It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
JERRY: It's good to have you back.
JERRY: It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
JERRY: It's green.
JERRY: It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
JERRY: It's hard to say.
JERRY: It's hardly been used.
JERRY: It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
JERRY: It's here!
JERRY: It's impossible
JERRY: It's inhumane!
JERRY: It's Isosceles
JERRY: It's Jerry.
JERRY: It's Jerry. Who's this?
JERRY: It's just hair.
JERRY: It's just like in the movies.
JERRY: It's just...
JERRY: It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
JERRY: It's kind of cozy.
JERRY: It's kinda old, isn't it?
JERRY: It's kinda private.
JERRY: It's Kramer.
JERRY: It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
JERRY: It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
JERRY: It's like 10 minutes by subway.
JERRY: It's like a game of tag.
JERRY: It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
JERRY: It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
JERRY: It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
JERRY: It's like this all the time.
JERRY: It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
JERRY: It's like watching an animal get tortured.
JERRY: It's like we're living in the '50s here.
JERRY: It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
JERRY: It's ludicrous..
JERRY: It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
JERRY: It's moronic.
JERRY: It's nice to get a reach.
JERRY: It's nice to meet you!
JERRY: It's not a purse. It's European!
JERRY: It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
JERRY: It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah
JERRY: It's not a valet, it's a protégé.
JERRY: It's not bad.
JERRY: It's not complicated.
JERRY: It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
JERRY: It's not even my car, it's a rental.
JERRY: It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
JERRY: It's not going to happen.
JERRY: It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look stupid. I'm sorry.
JERRY: It's not good.
JERRY: It's not here.
JERRY: It's not legitimate.
JERRY: It's not like she's *in* the movie.
JERRY: It's not like that at all.
JERRY: It's not like you're my wife.
JERRY: It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
JERRY: It's not necessary.
JERRY: It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
JERRY: It's not that bright orange one is it?
JERRY: It's not that hard.
JERRY: It's not totally impossible.
JERRY: It's not true!
JERRY: It's not.
JERRY: It's okay, that's not bad.
JERRY: It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
JERRY: It's on the door.
JERRY: It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that.
JERRY: It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
JERRY: It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
JERRY: It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
JERRY: It's only nine o clock.
JERRY: It's over there. I know where it is.
JERRY: It's over?
JERRY: It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
JERRY: It's Patty.
JERRY: It's pompous.
JERRY: It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. How can you defend that?
JERRY: It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
JERRY: It's really not necessary.
JERRY: It's routine surgery.
JERRY: It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
JERRY: It's silly!
JERRY: It's softer.
JERRY: It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
JERRY: It's still bleak.
JERRY: It's stuck. Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
JERRY: It's subtle.
JERRY: It's Sunday.
JERRY: It's supposed to be hot.
JERRY: It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
JERRY: It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
JERRY: It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
JERRY: It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
JERRY: It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
JERRY: It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
JERRY: It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
JERRY: It's true.
JERRY: It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
JERRY: It's unheard of ...
JERRY: It's working. Don't tap on the glass.
JERRY: It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.
JERRY: It's your Christmas present.
JERRY: It's your fault!
JERRY: It's your third day..
JERRY: It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
JERRY: It-it rhymes with a female body part.
JERRY: It.
JERRY: It.
JERRY: Itll take two seconds.
JERRY: Its a bet.
JERRY: Its a good mirror. So, what are you gettin?
JERRY: Its a joke.
JERRY: Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. I need it. What are you doing?
JERRY: Its good to see you.
JERRY: Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish three days.
JERRY: Its just unbelievable.
JERRY: Its mostly water weight.
JERRY: Its never happened to me before.
JERRY: Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
JERRY: Its partially you, yeah.
JERRY: Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
JERRY: Its too far.
JERRY: Its tremendous.
JERRY: Its uh okay.
JERRY: Its very bad.
JERRY: Its very good cantaloupe. So thats it? Youre out?
JERRY: Its very good.
JERRY: Its wonderful.
JERRY: Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
JERRY: Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
JERRY: Ill be right back.
JERRY: Ill call him. Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? Would you shut up?! Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
JERRY: Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
JERRY: Ill drive you to the airport.
JERRY: Ill give you 50 cents.
JERRY: Ill give you a year.
JERRY: Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
JERRY: Ill have an egg white omelet.
JERRY: Ill have the salmon.
JERRY: Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
JERRY: Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
JERRY: Ill tell you later.
JERRY: Ill try and remember that.
JERRY: Im a guy  it always looks like that.
JERRY: Im a little nervous.
JERRY: Im a nice guy.
JERRY: Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
JERRY: Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
JERRY: Im going out.
JERRY: Im gonna do it in Farsi.
JERRY: Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
JERRY: Im in for five...
JERRY: Im in heaven.
JERRY: Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
JERRY: Im just a regular person.
JERRY: Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?
JERRY: Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
JERRY: Im just saying..Alright.
JERRY: Im just so glad its back.
JERRY: Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
JERRY: Im no cat killer.
JERRY: Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.
JERRY: Im not looking.
JERRY: Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
JERRY: Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
JERRY: Im not taking it back.
JERRY: Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
JERRY: Im sorry.
JERRY: Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
JERRY: Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
JERRY: Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
JERRY: Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
JERRY: Ive got a ballpark.
JERRY: Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
JERRY: Jack.
JERRY: Jane's topless.
JERRY: Jean-Paul!
JERRY: Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
JERRY: Jenna's like me. She's very...
JERRY: Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: Jerry!
JERRY: Jerry!

JERRY: Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
JERRY: Jim Fowler? The animal guy from Wild Kingdom is coming to your apartment?
JERRY: Jimmy
JERRY: Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine..

JERRY: Jimmy?

JERRY: Jody the masseuse.
JERRY: Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?
JERRY: Joe Divola.
JERRY: Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
JERRY: John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
JERRY: John Houseman?
JERRY: Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
JERRY: Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
JERRY: Just - just park yourself. Alright. Act I, Scene A.
JERRY: Just . . . do it.
JERRY: Just a huge massive coronary.
JERRY: Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
JERRY: Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
JERRY: Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
JERRY: Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
JERRY: Just break up with him?
JERRY: Just call me if you hear anything. Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!

JERRY: just press it
JERRY: Just put a coffee table book over it.
JERRY: Just put it under your shirt.
JERRY: Just put it.
JERRY: Just relax, you'll be fine.
JERRY: Just swallow 'em.
JERRY: Just talking? Well what's the show about?
JERRY: Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
JERRY: Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
JERRY: Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.

JERRY: Kinda cool lookin'..
JERRY: Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.

JERRY: Larry, wait, you don't understand!
JERRY: Last check-in, they were still on him.
JERRY: Last one.
JERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?
JERRY: Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.
JERRY: Laura.
JERRY: Lean your head back. Open your mouth! Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
JERRY: leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks.
JERRY: Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.

JERRY: Let go!
JERRY: Let go, Elaine!
JERRY: Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! So what would you do?
JERRY: Let me ask you a question.
JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
JERRY: Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
JERRY: Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
JERRY: Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
JERRY: Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
JERRY: Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
JERRY: Let me get a clean pair.
JERRY: Let me get that.

JERRY: Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?

JERRY: Let's go.
JERRY: Let's just make a run for it.
JERRY: Let's not even analyze it.
JERRY: Let's put him over here.
JERRY: Let's see what he says.
JERRY: Lets hear yours.
JERRY: Lets talk about that.
JERRY: Levels?
JERRY: Like a frightened turtle!
JERRY: Like a grandmother, why?
JERRY: like a shark fisherman with a bucket of Ch....
JERRY: Like a shrimp farmer....
JERRY: Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
JERRY: Like fire in a school is such a big deal.
JERRY: Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
JERRY: Like that
JERRY: Like the Batman villain?
JERRY: Like this?
JERRY: Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
JERRY: Like toothpaste?
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
JERRY: Like who?
JERRY: Like with dogs.
JERRY: like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
JERRY: Like you care.
JERRY: Like you didn't call me a phony?
JERRY: Line two?
JERRY: Lip area.
JERRY: Lippman?
JERRY: Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
JERRY: Listen buddy,
JERRY: Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
JERRY: Listen to this: I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity.
JERRY: Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
JERRY: Listen, George, little problem with the game.
JERRY: Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
JERRY: Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
JERRY: Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
JERRY: Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
JERRY: Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
JERRY: Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...
JERRY: Listen, Ma...
JERRY: Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
JERRY: Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
JERRY: Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
JERRY: Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
JERRY: Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just recede into the night, if you know what I mean.
JERRY: Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
JERRY: Little buffer zone.
JERRY: Live together?
JERRY: Live?
JERRY: Living or all time?
JERRY: Lloyd.
JERRY: Lloyd?
JERRY: Lloyd?
JERRY: Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
JERRY: Loleola?
JERRY: Lomez is Jewish?
JERRY: Loni Anderson.
JERRY: Look at him.
JERRY: Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
JERRY: Look at my picture!
JERRY: Look at that guy. I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
JERRY: Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?
JERRY: Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
JERRY: Look at the picture on this thing...
JERRY: Look at the size of his bird!
JERRY: Look at this
JERRY: Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
JERRY: Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
JERRY: Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
JERRY: Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
JERRY: Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
JERRY: Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
JERRY: Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
JERRY: Look at this.
JERRY: Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
JERRY: Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
JERRY: Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
JERRY: Look at you, you got the job.
JERRY: Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
JERRY: Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on.
JERRY: Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
JERRY: Look at your skin.
JERRY: Look I don't know.
JERRY: Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
JERRY: Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
JERRY: Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
JERRY: Look out!
JERRY: Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
JERRY: Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
JERRY: Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
JERRY: Look who's here! Georgie-boy!
JERRY: Look! I don't want 'em!
JERRY: Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
JERRY: Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
JERRY: Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, Kramer, turn that up.
JERRY: Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
JERRY: Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
JERRY: Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
JERRY: Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
JERRY: Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
JERRY: Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
JERRY: Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
JERRY: Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
JERRY: Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
JERRY: Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
JERRY: Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
JERRY: Look, I'm sorry-
JERRY: Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
JERRY: Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
JERRY: Look, it's not my shirt.
JERRY: Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.
JERRY: Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
JERRY: Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
JERRY: Look, my friend saw you.
JERRY: Look, no-one is lifting anything.
JERRY: Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
JERRY: Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
JERRY: Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
JERRY: Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
JERRY: Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it...
JERRY: Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
JERRY: Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
JERRY: Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
JERRY: Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
JERRY: Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
JERRY: Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
JERRY: Look, what do you want me to do?
JERRY: Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
JERRY: Look, you can hang out here if you want.
JERRY: Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
JERRY: Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
JERRY: Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.
JERRY: Look.
JERRY: Look. Just, forget it, . All right?
JERRY: Look...look at this can of tuna!
JERRY: Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
JERRY: Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
JERRY: Looks like a swan.
JERRY: Looks like he gave you some Novocaine
JERRY: Looks like there is?
JERRY: Looters.
JERRY: Lopper.
JERRY: Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
JERRY: Lord of the manor.
JERRY: Lose that? That's not a Hollywood expression!
JERRY: Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
JERRY: Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
JERRY: Love that babka.
JERRY: Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
JERRY: Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
JERRY: Ma!
JERRY: Ma! Ma! MAAA! Oh, ahhhh
JERRY: Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
JERRY: Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
JERRY: Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
JERRY: Ma, it's not true!
JERRY: Ma, will you go already?
JERRY: Ma, will you stop?
JERRY: Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! Dad, shes cheating!
JERRY: Ma.
JERRY: Ma.
JERRY: Madeline stays here.
JERRY: Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
JERRY: Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
JERRY: Make them interesting.
JERRY: Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender!
JERRY: Male roommate, huh?
JERRY: Mammal.
JERRY: Man that thing is noisy!
JERRY: Man these are tight. Squinch your hips in
JERRY: Manly.
JERRY: Manny...
JERRY: Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
JERRY: Marine biology.
JERRY: Marisa Tomei?
JERRY: Marla, Kramer.
JERRY: Marla?
JERRY: Marlene.
JERRY: Maroon Golf.
JERRY: Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
JERRY: Martine?
JERRY: Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.
JERRY: Matthew, Luke, Paul, what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
JERRY: May I see you outside for a moment please?
JERRY: May I?
JERRY: Maybe a Cadillac.
JERRY: Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
JERRY: Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
JERRY: Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
JERRY: Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
JERRY: Maybe he didn't know?
JERRY: Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
JERRY: Maybe he has money.
JERRY: Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
JERRY: Maybe he knows O'Brien?
JERRY: Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
JERRY: Maybe he'll write a song about you.
JERRY: Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
JERRY: Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
JERRY: Maybe I am.
JERRY: Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
JERRY: Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
JERRY: Maybe I should ask her out?
JERRY: Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
JERRY: Maybe I will, Lois. Maybe I will.
JERRY: Maybe I will.
JERRY: Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
JERRY: Maybe I'll check out France.
JERRY: Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
JERRY: Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
JERRY: Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
JERRY: Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
JERRY: Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
JERRY: Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
JERRY: Maybe it's a shortcut.
JERRY: Maybe it's in the lost and found.
JERRY: Maybe it's not on this level.
JERRY: Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
JERRY: Maybe she'll sweeten.
JERRY: Maybe that's why she's happy.
JERRY: Maybe the fat camp. You're not going?
JERRY: Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
JERRY: Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
JERRY: Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
JERRY: Maybe they're admiring your spot.
JERRY: Maybe they've all been faking.
JERRY: Maybe this isn't my coat.
JERRY: Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
JERRY: Maybe we should call this off.
JERRY: Maybe we should go.
JERRY: Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
JERRY: Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
JERRY: Maybe you can just go back.
JERRY: Maybe you can soak in the tub.
JERRY: Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
JERRY: Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
JERRY: Maybe you just didn't see him.
JERRY: Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
JERRY: Maybe you should date the mothers.
JERRY: Maybe you won't like it.
JERRY: Maybe you're a little jealous.
JERRY: Maybe you're getting' a raise.
JERRY: Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
JERRY: Maybe youre right.
JERRY: Maybe!
JERRY: Maybe, maybe
JERRY: Maybe.
JERRY: Maybe.
JERRY: Maybe.
JERRY: Me either.
JERRY: Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up. Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
JERRY: Me too!
JERRY: Me too.
JERRY: Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
JERRY: Me, why?
JERRY: Me.
JERRY: Me?
JERRY: Me?
JERRY: Me?
JERRY: Me? Godfather?
JERRY: Me? What about you?
JERRY: Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
JERRY: Me? Why me?
JERRY: Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! Well what happened in the game anyway?
JERRY: Medium crab bisque.
JERRY: Medium crab bisque.
JERRY: Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
JERRY: Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
JERRY: Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, Rerun, don't wanna watch it..  What are you watching? I don't care, I gotta keep going. Who was that? I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going. Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel. You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching
JERRY: Mentor? You mean your boss.
JERRY: Meryl Streep?
JERRY: Mickey Mantle?
JERRY: Middle drawer.
JERRY: Midnight Express, my friend.
JERRY: Miffed.
JERRY: Mike thinks I'm a phony.
JERRY: Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. Phony?
JERRY: Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
JERRY: Milos?
JERRY: Mine too, love the 12 gauge.
JERRY: Mine!
JERRY: Mine!
JERRY: Minsk?
JERRY: Miss.
JERRY: Mm-hm.
JERRY: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..
JERRY: Mm. That's fantastic.
JERRY: Mmhu.
JERRY: Mmm
JERRY: Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?
JERRY: Mmm, succulent.
JERRY: Mmm-hmm.
JERRY: Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
JERRY: Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
JERRY: Mmm.
JERRY: Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
JERRY: Mmm.. Bad how?
JERRY: Mohair, I think.
JERRY: Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
JERRY: Mom, Dad.....I have fleas..
JERRY: Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
JERRY: Mom, I'm not married.
JERRY: Mom, you too?
JERRY: Momentum - same thing.
JERRY: Mona a Baldo .
JERRY: Monday, I think.
JERRY: More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
JERRY: More everything!
JERRY: More heavy gravy?
JERRY: More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
JERRY: More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
JERRY: More sheets per roll
JERRY: Morning.
JERRY: Morning.
JERRY: Morning?
JERRY: Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
JERRY: Mother of God.
JERRY: Move it! Move it! Get going!
JERRY: Moved?
JERRY: Mr Mandelbaum, I...
JERRY: Mr Mandelbaum, please.
JERRY: Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
JERRY: Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
JERRY: Mr. Fields?
JERRY: Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?
JERRY: Mr. Vandelay, of course.
JERRY: Mugged?
JERRY: Mulva.
JERRY: Mulva...
JERRY: Mulva?
JERRY: Mulva?
JERRY: Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
JERRY: Music?
JERRY: Musicians. Get a real job.
JERRY: Must I?
JERRY: My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
JERRY: My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
JERRY: My cable hook-up? What about it?
JERRY: My car!
JERRY: My car's in the shop.
JERRY: My car? You drove it into the swamp!
JERRY: My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
JERRY: My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?
JERRY: My door?
JERRY: My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
JERRY: My foot fell asleep.
JERRY: My foot fell asleep.
JERRY: My foot's asleep again!
JERRY: My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
JERRY: My god, are you okay?
JERRY: My grandfather gave me a statue!
JERRY: My grandmother's in the hospital.
JERRY: My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
JERRY: My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah?
JERRY: My Indian?
JERRY: My jacket?
JERRY: My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
JERRY: My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
JERRY: My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
JERRY: My mother's.
JERRY: My Nana?
JERRY: My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
JERRY: My neighbour:
JERRY: My pants!
JERRY: My parents are moving back too!
JERRY: My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
JERRY: My show from last night.
JERRY: My stomach, I, think it was that cookie.
JERRY: My what?
JERRY: My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
JERRY: My, isn't this an awkward moment?
JERRY: Myanmar.
JERRY: Myra, Stan.
JERRY: N-na I'm paying for the trip.
JERRY: Na, that's not such a good idea.
JERRY: Na, uh, no, uh, I'll hitch hike.
JERRY: Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song.
JERRY: Nah!
JERRY: Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
JERRY: Nah, don't bother.
JERRY: Nah, forget it.
JERRY: Nah, he didn't make it.
JERRY: Nah, I don't think so.
JERRY: Nah, I don't wanna
JERRY: Nah, I don't wanna go.
JERRY: Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
JERRY: Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
JERRY: Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
JERRY: Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
JERRY: Nah, it's not for me.
JERRY: Nah, Ill go get the robe.
JERRY: Nah, look at this. Cable's out.
JERRY: Nah, nah. I'd rather...
JERRY: Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
JERRY: Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
JERRY: Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.
JERRY: Nah, we've seen it.
JERRY: Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
JERRY: Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
JERRY: Nah, you're crazy anyway.
JERRY: Nah.
JERRY: Nah.
JERRY: Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
JERRY: Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.
JERRY: Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
JERRY: Nah. You two go.
JERRY: Nah...
JERRY: Name it.
JERRY: Name tags?
JERRY: Named Sharon?
JERRY: Named Suze?
JERRY: Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
JERRY: Nana's missing?
JERRY: Nancy Klopper?
JERRY: Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
JERRY: Naturally.
JERRY: Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
JERRY: Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
JERRY: NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
JERRY: NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
JERRY: NBC!?! Give me the phone!

JERRY: Newman's his mailman.
JERRY: Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? What happened?
JERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
JERRY: Newman, too?
JERRY: Newman.
JERRY: Newman.
JERRY: Newman. He's going with Newman.
JERRY: Newman?

JERRY: No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
JERRY: No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
JERRY: No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.

JERRY: No one knows.
JERRY: No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
JERRY: No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
JERRY: No one's going to do that.
JERRY: No one's gonna listen to you.
JERRY: No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.

JERRY: No thanks.
JERRY: No thanks.
JERRY: No thanks.
JERRY: No the stools go over there.
JERRY: No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
JERRY: No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
JERRY: No they're not, they used to be.
JERRY: No time? Is there time?
JERRY: No tippy toe.
JERRY: No tune.
JERRY: No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. Becker, ... Becker, ...

JERRY: No! No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
JERRY: No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
JERRY: No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
JERRY: No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!
JERRY: No! That's the wrong doll!
JERRY: No! There's no T-bone!
JERRY: No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
JERRY: No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
JERRY: No, a dollar, two tops.
JERRY: No, absolutely nothing. You're fantastic! Hey guys!
JERRY: No, actually I was just gonna...
JERRY: No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?

JERRY: No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
JERRY: No, but he would've read your face.
JERRY: No, but he's not looking good...
JERRY: No, but I expect to hear anytime.
JERRY: No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
JERRY: No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
JERRY: No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
JERRY: No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
JERRY: No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
JERRY: No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
JERRY: No, c'mon Kramer. Gimme that picture.
JERRY: No, cab's comin' in right here Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.

JERRY: No, certainly not.
JERRY: No, come on!
JERRY: No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
JERRY: No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
JERRY: No, did you?
JERRY: No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
JERRY: No, don't cancel it.
JERRY: No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
JERRY: No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
JERRY: No, Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive.
JERRY: No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it.
JERRY: No, for both!
JERRY: No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
JERRY: No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
JERRY: No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
JERRY: No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
JERRY: No, go ahead.
JERRY: No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.

JERRY: No, he didn't use 'man'.
JERRY: No, he doesn't.
JERRY: No, he just doesn't like me.
JERRY: No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.

JERRY: No, I asked him.
JERRY: No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
JERRY: No, I believe he can.
JERRY: No, I believe it's next week.
JERRY: No, I can't do details.
JERRY: No, I can't feel anything.
JERRY: No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
JERRY: No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
JERRY: No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
JERRY: No, I didnt!
JERRY: No, I do not challenge.
JERRY: No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
JERRY: No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
JERRY: No, I don't drink coffee.
JERRY: No, I don't have any ashtrays.
JERRY: No, I don't have--
JERRY: No, I don't know if I'm invited.

JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
JERRY: No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
JERRY: No, I dont.
JERRY: No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.

JERRY: No, I hadn't noticed.
JERRY: No, I haven't heard anything.

JERRY: No, I mean, I don't think so.
JERRY: No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.
JERRY: No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
JERRY: No, I read in the paper..
JERRY: No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
JERRY: No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
JERRY: No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
JERRY: No, I told you I admire your hearing.
JERRY: No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
JERRY: No, I tried it on. It fits good.
JERRY: No, I tried. they don't know anything. You gotta put the syrup in first.
JERRY: No, I want the picture back.
JERRY: No, I was following him.
JERRY: No, I wouldn't think so.
JERRY: No, I'll be back.
JERRY: No, I'll crab it.
JERRY: No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
JERRY: No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
JERRY: No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
JERRY: No, I'm calling her.
JERRY: No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
JERRY: No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
JERRY: No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
JERRY: No, I'm not...
JERRY: No, I'm okay.
JERRY: No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.

JERRY: No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
JERRY: No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
JERRY: No, it isn't. I can find out.
JERRY: No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
JERRY: No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
JERRY: No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
JERRY: No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...

JERRY: No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. Hello-o-o-o.
JERRY: No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
JERRY: No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!

JERRY: No, no, no. Just hypothetically.
JERRY: No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
JERRY: No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
JERRY: No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
JERRY: No, no, not at all.
JERRY: No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
JERRY: No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
JERRY: No, no, the--
JERRY: No, no, there's no side!
JERRY: No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
JERRY: No, no, would you get up?
JERRY: No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
JERRY: No, no.
JERRY: No, no.
JERRY: No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
JERRY: No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
JERRY: No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
JERRY: No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
JERRY: No, no. I'll take the subway.
JERRY: No, no. It's the valet guy.
JERRY: No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
JERRY: No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
JERRY: No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
JERRY: No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
JERRY: No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
JERRY: No, no...... Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
JERRY: No, nonsense. This one's fine.
JERRY: No, not a thing.
JERRY: No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
JERRY: No, not on me.
JERRY: No, not particularly.
JERRY: No, not yet.
JERRY: No, Nothing.
JERRY: No, nothing.
JERRY: No, nothing.
JERRY: No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
JERRY: No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
JERRY: No, of course not, of course not!
JERRY: No, of course not.
JERRY: No, people hate that.
JERRY: No, Poppie! No!!
JERRY: No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
JERRY: No, really.. an airport run.
JERRY: No, road is a major detail!
JERRY: No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
JERRY: No, separated.
JERRY: No, she looks completely normal.
JERRY: No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
JERRY: No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
JERRY: No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun..
JERRY: No, she's not.
JERRY: No, she's not.
JERRY: No, shes a little too cheery for me.
JERRY: No, shower. So, where are we eating?
JERRY: No, supermarket.
JERRY: No, thank you.
JERRY: No, thank you.
JERRY: No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
JERRY: No, that's Krama.
JERRY: No, that's midtown.
JERRY: No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
JERRY: No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
JERRY: No, that's the rule. It's optional.
JERRY: No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
JERRY: No, thats great! Thats terrific!
JERRY: No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
JERRY: No, there's less.
JERRY: No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
JERRY: No, they won't call the police.
JERRY: No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
JERRY: No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
JERRY: No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
JERRY: No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
JERRY: No, Trini Lopez.
JERRY: No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
JERRY: No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
JERRY: No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
JERRY: No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
JERRY: No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
JERRY: No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
JERRY: No, we don't care, we just want to go.
JERRY: No, we have time.
JERRY: No, we're having an intervention
JERRY: No, what'd you say?
JERRY: No, what?
JERRY: No, what? What kind is it?
JERRY: No, what? Thats probably why..
JERRY: No, why should I? I wear boxers.
JERRY: No, yada yada is good. She's very succinct.
JERRY: No, you didn't.
JERRY: No, you don't have to buy anything.
JERRY: No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
JERRY: No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
JERRY: No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
JERRY: No, you idiot.
JERRY: No, you stay here in the car.
JERRY: No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!
JERRY: No, you walk out.
JERRY: No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
JERRY: No, you'd have to be crazy.
JERRY: No, you're not.
JERRY: No,, but thank you.
JERRY: No-o-o-o.
JERRY: No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.

JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
JERRY: No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
JERRY: No. Come on up.
JERRY: No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
JERRY: No. Did you at least pick them up?
JERRY: No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
JERRY: No. I can't say as I have.
JERRY: No. I don't.
JERRY: No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
JERRY: No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
JERRY: No. I know what I want.
JERRY: No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
JERRY: No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
JERRY: No. I never had a job.
JERRY: No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
JERRY: No. I think it's Demi.
JERRY: No. I told you not to say anything.
JERRY: No. I'm fine, thank you.
JERRY: No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
JERRY: No. I'm not really looking.
JERRY: No. I'm waiting for...
JERRY: No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
JERRY: No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
JERRY: No. It's still a goodbye.
JERRY: No. Jacket and tie: no cape.
JERRY: No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi--
JERRY: No. Never.
JERRY: No. No lunch.
JERRY: No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
JERRY: No. No Suze.
JERRY: No. No thanks.
JERRY: No. No you're not.
JERRY: No. No, I can't!
JERRY: No. No, no way, no Bania.
JERRY: No. No. I don't mind at all.
JERRY: No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
JERRY: No. None.
JERRY: No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
JERRY: No. nothing.
JERRY: No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
JERRY: No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this
JERRY: No. So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
JERRY: No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
JERRY: No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
JERRY: No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
JERRY: No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
JERRY: No. Thats out of the question.
JERRY: No. The police have no leads and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
JERRY: No. The sex was fabulous.
JERRY: No. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
JERRY: No. Things pop into your head. You?
JERRY: No. We both just saw the same monkey.
JERRY: No. We gotta go to the soup place.
JERRY: No. What happened to you?
JERRY: No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1, 900 dollars.
JERRY: No. Why?
JERRY: No. Would you just get out?
JERRY: No. Yes you can.
JERRY: No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
JERRY: No. You're never here.
JERRY: No. You?
JERRY: No. You?
JERRY: No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
JERRY: No.. you?
JERRY: No...
JERRY: No...
JERRY: No...
JERRY: No... I find them repugnant and unappealing.
JERRY: No....
JERRY: No...Got dental appointment.
JERRY: No?
JERRY: Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
JERRY: Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
JERRY: Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. What the hell are you doing?
JERRY: Nobody needs to talk.
JERRY: Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
JERRY: Nobody you know...
JERRY: Nodding off...
JERRY: Noit your type?
JERRY: Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
JERRY: None.
JERRY: Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
JERRY: Nooo, I don't.
JERRY: Nooo.
JERRY: Nooo.
JERRY: Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
JERRY: Nope. I don't think so.
JERRY: Nope. You?
JERRY: Not a Federal record.
JERRY: Not a good sign.
JERRY: Not a very long trip.
JERRY: Not all of 'em!
JERRY: Not as long.
JERRY: Not at all.
JERRY: Not at the moment, Brett.
JERRY: Not bad!
JERRY: Not bad.
JERRY: Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
JERRY: Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
JERRY: Not comfortable...
JERRY: Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
JERRY: Not even on the book jacket?
JERRY: Not even once?
JERRY: Not everybody likes everybody!
JERRY: Not exactly.
JERRY: Not fair.
JERRY: Not for another three days.
JERRY: Not for me, I love chatting.
JERRY: Not from the footage I've seen.
JERRY: Not getting it.
JERRY: Not goin' to the Knick game.
JERRY: Not good
JERRY: Not good.
JERRY: Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
JERRY: Not if they don't know you...
JERRY: Not if you have a doctor's note.
JERRY: Not me.
JERRY: Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
JERRY: Not necessarily because.....
JERRY: Not now. She's right inside.
JERRY: Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
JERRY: Not once.
JERRY: Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
JERRY: Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
JERRY: Not our all the way, their all the way. I got the stink of responsibility on me.
JERRY: Not Pennypacker!
JERRY: Not possible.
JERRY: Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
JERRY: Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
JERRY: Not since June 29, 1980.
JERRY: Not that I would think of doing such things.
JERRY: Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
JERRY: Not that there's anything wrong with that...
JERRY: NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!
JERRY: Not that, no..
JERRY: Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
JERRY: Not the gown again.
JERRY: Not this movie.
JERRY: Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
JERRY: Not today, pal.
JERRY: Not underpants.
JERRY: Not with a cane?
JERRY: Not yet.
JERRY: Not yet. The other guy.
JERRY: Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
JERRY: Not you.
JERRY: Not you. Older people.
JERRY: Not.
JERRY: Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
JERRY: Nothin' What do you want?
JERRY: Nothin'.
JERRY: Nothin'.....nothing at all.
JERRY: Nothing's happened.
JERRY: Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
JERRY: Nothing, nothing.
JERRY: Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
JERRY: Nothing, what's doing with you?
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
JERRY: Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
JERRY: Nothing. Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that.
JERRY: Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
JERRY: Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
JERRY: Nothing. I'm sure Jon probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I!
JERRY: Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
JERRY: Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -
JERRY: Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
JERRY: Nothing...
JERRY: Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
JERRY: Now he's a character. So everybody I know is a character on the show.
JERRY: Now here's another little rule.
JERRY: Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
JERRY: Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
JERRY: Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
JERRY: Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly.
JERRY: Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
JERRY: Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
JERRY: Now that you mention it.
JERRY: Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry, I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
JERRY: Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
JERRY: Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
JERRY: Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
JERRY: Now we have to buy a new couch?!
JERRY: Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's Beaches for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
JERRY: Now what did you ask me again.
JERRY: Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
JERRY: Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
JERRY: Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
JERRY: Now you're talkin' crazy!
JERRY: NOW!!!!....
JERRY: Now, all we gotta do is write it.
JERRY: Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
JERRY: Now, how could that be good?
JERRY: Now, I'm not so sure.
JERRY: Now, its time to go.
JERRY: Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
JERRY: Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
JERRY: Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
JERRY: Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way?
JERRY: Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
JERRY: Now.
JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
JERRY: Number one?
JERRY: O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
JERRY: O.K.
JERRY: O.K.
JERRY: O.K.
JERRY: O.K. from now on I want you to call me Jerry the Great.
JERRY: O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
JERRY: O.K.!
JERRY: O.k., good, I'll see you later.
JERRY: O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.
JERRY: Obviously never.
JERRY: Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
JERRY: Obviously.
JERRY: Obviously.
JERRY: Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
JERRY: Odds.
JERRY: Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
JERRY: Of course I can, am I being funny now?
JERRY: Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card.
JERRY: Of course I want to talk about it.
JERRY: Of course I was getting you a note.
JERRY: Of course its a sliding scale.
JERRY: Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
JERRY: Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
JERRY: Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
JERRY: Of course was the last thing he said?
JERRY: Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
JERRY: Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
JERRY: of course you would
JERRY: Of course, I always do.
JERRY: Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
JERRY: Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
JERRY: Of course, they're polyester.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
JERRY: Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
JERRY: Of course. How are you?
JERRY: Of course. It's garbage.
JERRY: Of course. Yeah, go ahead.
JERRY: Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it.
JERRY: Of what?
JERRY: Oh
JERRY: Oh
JERRY: Oh a slinky.
JERRY: Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
JERRY: Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
JERRY: Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
JERRY: Oh boy, can you smell it?
JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
JERRY: Oh boy.
JERRY: Oh boy...
JERRY: Oh Come on!!
JERRY: Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
JERRY: Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
JERRY: Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
JERRY: Oh Diane.
JERRY: Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.
JERRY: Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
JERRY: Oh Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
JERRY: Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
JERRY: Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
JERRY: Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .
JERRY: Oh God he saw me.
JERRY: Oh God!
JERRY: Oh God! huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight?
JERRY: Oh god! What happened to you?!
JERRY: Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
JERRY: Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
JERRY: Oh God.
JERRY: Oh God.
JERRY: Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
JERRY: Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
JERRY: Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
JERRY: Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
JERRY: Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
JERRY: Oh hey Phil.
JERRY: Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
JERRY: Oh hi Alex.
JERRY: Oh hi Enzo.
JERRY: Oh hi Jack.
JERRY: Oh hi, Katie.
JERRY: Oh hi, Katie.
JERRY: Oh Hi.
JERRY: Oh hi.
JERRY: Oh hi.
JERRY: Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
JERRY: Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
JERRY: Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
JERRY: Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
JERRY: Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
JERRY: Oh I like that. It's like going back in time.
JERRY: Oh I see they have apple pie.
JERRY: oh I though you didn't care about his looks
JERRY: Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
JERRY: Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
JERRY: oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
JERRY: Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
JERRY: Oh it's a fascinating field!
JERRY: Oh it's damaged.
JERRY: Oh its your cat!
JERRY: Oh like you do.
JERRY: oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
JERRY: Oh look at this guy.

JERRY: Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
JERRY: Oh man...

JERRY: Oh my God is that the new perfume?
JERRY: Oh my God!
JERRY: Oh my God!
JERRY: Oh my god!
JERRY: Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
JERRY: Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
JERRY: Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
JERRY: Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
JERRY: Oh my god!!
JERRY: Oh my God, George!
JERRY: Oh my god, he knows. Go. One second.

JERRY: Oh my god, its Joe Divola
JERRY: Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?

JERRY: Oh my God, the blood!
JERRY: Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
JERRY: Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
JERRY: Oh my god, you're kidding. Hang on a second. It's JVN 728.
JERRY: Oh my God.
JERRY: Oh my god.
JERRY: Oh my god.
JERRY: Oh my god. Look at this.
JERRY: Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
JERRY: Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
JERRY: Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
JERRY: Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
JERRY: Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
JERRY: Oh my...
JERRY: Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
JERRY: Oh no you're not!
JERRY: Oh No!
JERRY: Oh no! &gt;click click&lt; Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
JERRY: Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
JERRY: Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
JERRY: Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
JERRY: Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
JERRY: Oh no, it's Kenny Bania.
JERRY: Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
JERRY: Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
JERRY: Oh no, not now.
JERRY: Oh no, not you too?
JERRY: Oh no, nothing.
JERRY: Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
JERRY: Oh no, where's the blood? It's in here isn't it?
JERRY: Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
JERRY: Oh no.
JERRY: Oh no.
JERRY: Oh no.
JERRY: Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
JERRY: Oh no. It's go time.
JERRY: Oh no. That was the dry heaves.
JERRY: Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
JERRY: Oh now I see. Yeah.
JERRY: Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
JERRY: Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
JERRY: Oh please, I love her.
JERRY: Oh please.
JERRY: Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
JERRY: Oh really?
JERRY: Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...
JERRY: Oh really? Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
JERRY: Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.
JERRY: Oh right, the new job, how is it?
JERRY: Oh screw him!
JERRY: Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
JERRY: Oh so what.
JERRY: Oh so you still don't believe us.
JERRY: Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
JERRY: Oh sure like Monet.
JERRY: Oh sure.
JERRY: Oh thank you very much.
JERRY: Oh that makes a lot of sense.
JERRY: Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
JERRY: Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
JERRY: Oh that's an old wives tale.
JERRY: Oh that's George. Yeah?
JERRY: Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
JERRY: Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
JERRY: Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
JERRY: Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
JERRY: Oh there's nothing to see.
JERRY: Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
JERRY: Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
JERRY: Oh this is interesting.
JERRY: Oh uh ...
JERRY: oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
JERRY: Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
JERRY: Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.

JERRY: Oh wait. Ill go with you.
JERRY: Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
JERRY: Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
JERRY: Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.
JERRY: Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
JERRY: Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
JERRY: Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
JERRY: Oh what, you're upset?
JERRY: Oh what...

JERRY: Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
JERRY: Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
JERRY: Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
JERRY: Oh yeah. This can't miss.
JERRY: Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
JERRY: Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
JERRY: Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?

JERRY: Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
JERRY: Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
JERRY: Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
JERRY: Oh! Hey!
JERRY: OH! Hey!!
JERRY: Oh! How d'you like that?
JERRY: Oh! I got a message.

JERRY: Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
JERRY: Oh! Shut up!!!
JERRY: Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
JERRY: Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, was, for two.
JERRY: Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
JERRY: oh! thank you.
JERRY: oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.

JERRY: Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
JERRY: Oh, a walk, well --
JERRY: Oh, about the... uh
JERRY: Oh, all the way.
JERRY: Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
JERRY: Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
JERRY: Oh, and who might that be?
JERRY: Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
JERRY: Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
JERRY: Oh, are you about done?
JERRY: Oh, Babu.
JERRY: Oh, beautiful did he like them?
JERRY: Oh, beautiful.
JERRY: Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
JERRY: Oh, because of all the singing?
JERRY: Oh, big fighting marlin.
JERRY: Oh, boy.
JERRY: Oh, boy.
JERRY: Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.
JERRY: Oh, by marriage. We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
JERRY: Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
JERRY: Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
JERRY: Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
JERRY: Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left.
JERRY: Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.
JERRY: Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
JERRY: Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
JERRY: Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
JERRY: Oh, come on.
JERRY: Oh, come on.
JERRY: Oh, come on.
JERRY: Oh, come on.
JERRY: Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
JERRY: Oh, come on. Thats not true.
JERRY: Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
JERRY: Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
JERRY: Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
JERRY: Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.
JERRY: Oh, cmon! Its down again?!
JERRY: Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
JERRY: Oh, did he like it?
JERRY: Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
JERRY: Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
JERRY: Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
JERRY: Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
JERRY: Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
JERRY: Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
JERRY: Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
JERRY: Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
JERRY: Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
JERRY: Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
JERRY: Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
JERRY: Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
JERRY: Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
JERRY: Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
JERRY: Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
JERRY: Oh, George can't click!
JERRY: Oh, George Costanza, Kennedy High.
JERRY: Oh, get out of here.
JERRY: Oh, go ahead.
JERRY: Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..
JERRY: Oh, God.
JERRY: Oh, good idea...
JERRY: Oh, good, men love that!
JERRY: Oh, good.
JERRY: Oh, good.
JERRY: Oh, great! Alright.
JERRY: Oh, great.
JERRY: Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
JERRY: Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
JERRY: Oh, great. That's great. What a night.
JERRY: Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
JERRY: Oh, he sang like a canary.
JERRY: Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
JERRY: Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
JERRY: Oh, he's coming.
JERRY: Oh, he's having a heart attack.
JERRY: Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
JERRY: Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art.
JERRY: Oh, he's this awful comedian.
JERRY: Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
JERRY: Oh, hello.
JERRY: Oh, Hello. Nine years, seems like a long time doesn't it? It is, and we've packed a lot in the four of us, it seems like every week a whole new set of problems would just crop up outta nowhere...except for summer where nothing seemed to happen for months at a time. Anyway the point is over the last nine years...
JERRY: Oh, hello...
JERRY: Oh, help me, Rhonda.
JERRY: Oh, here she comes.
JERRY: Oh, here she comes.
JERRY: Oh, hey Bania.
JERRY: Oh, hey Mike.
JERRY: Oh, hey Ramon.
JERRY: Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
JERRY: Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
JERRY: Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
JERRY: Oh, hey. You got in.
JERRY: Oh, Hi Beth
JERRY: Oh, hi Brett.
JERRY: Oh, hi dad.
JERRY: Oh, hi Ellen.
JERRY: Oh, hi Evelyn.
JERRY: Oh, hi Gennice.
JERRY: Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
JERRY: Oh, hi Rita.
JERRY: Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.
JERRY: Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?
JERRY: Oh, hi, Elaine.
JERRY: Oh, Hi, hi.
JERRY: Oh, Hi.
JERRY: Oh, hi.
JERRY: Oh, hi.
JERRY: Oh, Hi. A hundred episodes, that's a lot. During the course of which George, Elaine, Kramer and I have had many experiences both positive and negative. Well mostly negative, there have been some relationships that haven't worked out ambitions that were unfulfilled, hopes dashed, some property damage, hurt feels, I know one guy got deported, physical injury an... alright maybe even a death or two. But we've persevered because we're people... real
JERRY: Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
JERRY: Oh, Hi. I didn't realize you'd be back soo soon. You know after a hundred episodes this apartment has really seen a lot of action. George, Kramer, that girl... Elaine. But in the end it's really a show about people, people who really care about each other and I think that says something, I guess, I dunno. Just watch
JERRY: Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
JERRY: Oh, hi. Soda?
JERRY: Oh, hold on. It's George, he just got home.
JERRY: Oh, how can you be so sure?
JERRY: Oh, how come?
JERRY: Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
JERRY: Oh, I can take it.
JERRY: Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
JERRY: Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
JERRY: Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!
JERRY: Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
JERRY: Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
JERRY: oh, I d-I don't know. I d---
JERRY: Oh, I didn't do anything.
JERRY: Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
JERRY: Oh, I don't believe this.
JERRY: Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
JERRY: Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
JERRY: Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
JERRY: Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..
JERRY: Oh, I don't want to bother you.
JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
JERRY: Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
JERRY: Oh, I got the machine.
JERRY: Oh, I got to see this thing.
JERRY: Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
JERRY: Oh, I guess it's broken!
JERRY: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
JERRY: Oh, I had that comin' to me.
JERRY: Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
JERRY: Oh, I know her. I know her type.
JERRY: Oh, I know you are.
JERRY: Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
JERRY: Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
JERRY: Oh, I see. So you can go, Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!
JERRY: Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
JERRY: Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
JERRY: Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
JERRY: Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.
JERRY: Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
JERRY: Oh, I wouldnt quite say that.
JERRY: Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
JERRY: Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
JERRY: Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
JERRY: Oh, I'm back, baby.
JERRY: Oh, I'm delighted.
JERRY: Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
JERRY: Oh, I'm gonna puke.
JERRY: Oh, I'm gonna puke.
JERRY: Oh, I'm Jerry.
JERRY: Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
JERRY: Oh, I'm so sorry.
JERRY: Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure they are.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure you do.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, Those aren't buoys. Father...
JERRY: Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
JERRY: Oh, I'm the doofus?
JERRY: Oh, I, I, think I remember..
JERRY: Oh, in a minute, Carol.
JERRY: Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
JERRY: Oh, is this a bit?
JERRY: Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
JERRY: Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
JERRY: Oh, it doesn't matter now.
JERRY: Oh, it was a lovely affair.
JERRY: Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
JERRY: Oh, it was nothing.
JERRY: Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
JERRY: Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
JERRY: Oh, it won't be for that long.
JERRY: Oh, it's a scene man.
JERRY: Oh, it's a scene.
JERRY: Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.
JERRY: Oh, it's enchanting.
JERRY: Oh, it's George.
JERRY: Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
JERRY: Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
JERRY: Oh, it's not that bad!
JERRY: Oh, it's nothing...
JERRY: Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
JERRY: Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
JERRY: Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
JERRY: Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
JERRY: Oh, its just this stupid thing.
JERRY: Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
JERRY: Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
JERRY: Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone.
JERRY: Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
JERRY: Oh, just trying to help me.. Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Listen, I - I just want to tell you, There's been a terrible misunderstanding: See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone. You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. Now she wants to have a drink with me. Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. Now I gotta have a drink with her.
JERRY: Oh, Kramer huh?
JERRY: Oh, Kramer, I -
JERRY: Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
JERRY: Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
JERRY: Oh, like you do.

JERRY: Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
JERRY: Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
JERRY: Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
JERRY: Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
JERRY: Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
JERRY: Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?

JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
JERRY: Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?

JERRY: Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
JERRY: Oh, that'll intrigue him.
JERRY: Oh, that's *fantastic*!
JERRY: Oh, that's a drag...
JERRY: Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.
JERRY: Oh, that's classy.
JERRY: Oh, that's gold, baby.
JERRY: Oh, that's gotta hurt.
JERRY: Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
JERRY: Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night.
JERRY: Oh, that's lovely.
JERRY: Oh, that's nice.
JERRY: Oh, that's okay.
JERRY: Oh, that's the Flicks.
JERRY: Oh, that's too bad.
JERRY: Oh, thats okay.
JERRY: Oh, the beach.
JERRY: Oh, the best revenge is living well.
JERRY: Oh, the dolphin thing?
JERRY: Oh, the gum.
JERRY: Oh, the guy from Jersey?
JERRY: Oh, the hell with her.
JERRY: Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
JERRY: Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
JERRY: Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
JERRY: Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
JERRY: Oh, the sisters
JERRY: Oh, the triangle guy.
JERRY: Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.
JERRY: Oh, the Yoo Hoo?
JERRY: Oh, then I gotta tip him.
JERRY: Oh, then I lost interest.
JERRY: Oh, then I'm not worried.
JERRY: Oh, there you are!
JERRY: Oh, there's no emergency...
JERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
JERRY: Oh, they're all the same. Here. Now if you'll excuse us, ..
JERRY: Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
JERRY: Oh, this is awful.
JERRY: Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?
JERRY: Oh, this is really annoying.
JERRY: Oh, this is ridiculous.
JERRY: Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
JERRY: Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
JERRY: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
JERRY: Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
JERRY: Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. . A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
JERRY: Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
JERRY: Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
JERRY: Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
JERRY: Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
JERRY: Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
JERRY: Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
JERRY: Oh, we all hated him.
JERRY: Oh, we finished early.
JERRY: Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
JERRY: Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
JERRY: Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
JERRY: Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there.
JERRY: Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
JERRY: Oh, well, now you're talking.
JERRY: Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.
JERRY: Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
JERRY: Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
JERRY: Oh, well.
JERRY: Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
JERRY: Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
JERRY: Oh, what are you doing here?
JERRY: Oh, what are you talkin' about?
JERRY: Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
JERRY: Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
JERRY: Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
JERRY: Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
JERRY: Oh, what's the point?
JERRY: Oh, whatever.
JERRY: Oh, when did that happen?
JERRY: Oh, Where did you eat?
JERRY: Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?
JERRY: Oh, whos gonna know?
JERRY: Oh, why not?
JERRY: Oh, why you havin' a party?
JERRY: Oh, why?
JERRY: Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
JERRY: Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
JERRY: Oh, wow.
JERRY: Oh, ya' going?
JERRY: Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.

JERRY: Oh, yeah, I understand. DOOR
JERRY: Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!

JERRY: Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
JERRY: Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
JERRY: Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Right.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
JERRY: Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
JERRY: Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
JERRY: Oh, yes you will.
JERRY: Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
JERRY: Oh, yes.
JERRY: Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.
JERRY: Oh, you already gave them away?
JERRY: Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.

JERRY: Oh, you have a daughter?
JERRY: Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!
JERRY: Oh, you idiots!
JERRY: Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
JERRY: Oh, you know what?
JERRY: Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, Oh. Tube socks. What are you gonna do about it?
JERRY: Oh, you know, the usual..
JERRY: Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
JERRY: Oh, you know.
JERRY: Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
JERRY: Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
JERRY: Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. So, how's the book coming? I say, how's the book comin'?
JERRY: Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
JERRY: Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
JERRY: Oh, you think she was refunding?
JERRY: Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
JERRY: Oh, you were pretty loaded.
JERRY: Oh, you'll find out.
JERRY: Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
JERRY: Oh, you're crazy.
JERRY: Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
JERRY: Oh, you're Pappy.
JERRY: Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
JERRY: Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.

JERRY: Oh. It's in your eye now.
JERRY: Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
JERRY: Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
JERRY: Oh. No. What, you mean because of the Chang?
JERRY: Oh. Oh, that's nice of 'em.

JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Okay. Didn't come true.
JERRY: Okay. Great. Thanks.
JERRY: Okay. Hi, Poppie.
JERRY: Okay. I mean, what if the--

JERRY: Okay. No calls the next day.
JERRY: Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
JERRY: Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
JERRY: Okay. Thank you, very much.
JERRY: Okay. Thanks.
JERRY: Okay..
JERRY: Okay..
JERRY: Okay..
JERRY: Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?

JERRY: Okay....too bad.
JERRY: Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?
JERRY: On many factors.
JERRY: On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
JERRY: On the couch.
JERRY: On the couch? So you're...
JERRY: On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
JERRY: On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
JERRY: On what?!
JERRY: On your heart?
JERRY: On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
JERRY: On your mothers life?
JERRY: Once a week? So how's Lydia?
JERRY: Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
JERRY: Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
JERRY: Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
JERRY: One message. Hope it's not from you.
JERRY: One more lane to go.
JERRY: One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity: Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
JERRY: One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say: He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.
JERRY: One second. Hello.
JERRY: One Tim Whatley!
JERRY: One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
JERRY: Ooh! Very convenient.
JERRY: Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
JERRY: Ooh, case closed!

JERRY: Ooh, nothing.
JERRY: Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!
JERRY: Ooh-ooh
JERRY: Ooh.
JERRY: Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
JERRY: Ooo, could be from that blonde
JERRY: Ooo, that was a bad toast.
JERRY: Oooh that. Well...
JERRY: Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!
JERRY: Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
JERRY: OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
JERRY: Oooh.
JERRY: Ooow, that was close.
JERRY: Oops.
JERRY: Open my vault?
JERRY: Open the package Leo.
JERRY: Opening.
JERRY: Opposite.
JERRY: Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
JERRY: Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
JERRY: Or something. Yeah, that's a date.
JERRY: Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
JERRY: osh.
JERRY: Other drivers?
JERRY: Ouch.
JERRY: Ouf.
JERRY: OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
JERRY: Out of town?
JERRY: Out.
JERRY: Out.
JERRY: Outside!

JERRY: Pardon?
JERRY: Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, Make sure you hang on to your jacket.
JERRY: Parsippany, New Jersey.
JERRY: Patti?
JERRY: Patty Lawrence had 'em!
JERRY: Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?

JERRY: Paul again?
JERRY: Peach.
JERRY: Pendant? Those bastards.
JERRY: Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
JERRY: Pennypacker.
JERRY: People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
JERRY: People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
JERRY: People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
JERRY: People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
JERRY: People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
JERRY: Perfect.
JERRY: Perpetuation of the species.
JERRY: Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
JERRY: Pez?
JERRY: Pff.
JERRY: Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
JERRY: Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
JERRY: Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
JERRY: Pinkish hue?
JERRY: Pinter?
JERRY: Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
JERRY: Plane's ready.
JERRY: Plantains?

JERRY: Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
JERRY: Please, don't make me beg.
JERRY: Please, Donna...
JERRY: Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
JERRY: Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
JERRY: Please-
JERRY: Please.
JERRY: Please.
JERRY: Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
JERRY: Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. Shes unbelievable!

JERRY: Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
JERRY: Positive.
JERRY: Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
JERRY: Possibly.
JERRY: Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
JERRY: Pretend it's interesting.
JERRY: Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
JERRY: Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
JERRY: Pretty good.
JERRY: Pretty good.
JERRY: Pretty good. I think she might be the one.

JERRY: Pretty nice.
JERRY: Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
JERRY: Pride?
JERRY: Prior convictions? Leo?
JERRY: Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
JERRY: Probably the reason..
JERRY: Problem in the bedroom?
JERRY: Problem?
JERRY: Problems with the house guest?
JERRY: Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
JERRY: Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh.
JERRY: Prognosis *negative*!?
JERRY: Prognosis Negative.
JERRY: Projectionists.
JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
JERRY: Puffy.
JERRY: Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
JERRY: Pull over? You can't pull over.
JERRY: Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
JERRY: Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
JERRY: Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
JERRY: Put it in.

JERRY: Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
JERRY: Rabies.
JERRY: Rachel!
JERRY: Rachel!
JERRY: Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
JERRY: Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
JERRY: Raspberry, Strawberry ...

JERRY: Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
JERRY: Reer.
JERRY: Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O.
JERRY: Relax. Who are they?
JERRY: Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
JERRY: Remember Babu Bhatt?

JERRY: Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?

JERRY: Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
JERRY: Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
JERRY: Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
JERRY: Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.

JERRY: Salami salami bologna?
JERRY: Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
JERRY: Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
JERRY: Sally? Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
JERRY: Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. What's the matter?
JERRY: Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
JERRY: Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
JERRY: Sammy Davis had it.
JERRY: Sample? Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
JERRY: Satisfied?
JERRY: Saturday night
JERRY: Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
JERRY: Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
JERRY: Saving movies.
JERRY: Say Dad, isn't that one of yours?
JERRY: Say something funny.
JERRY: Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
JERRY: Scared the hell out of that guy.
JERRY: Scarf?
JERRY: Scary cold.
JERRY: Schumann. Where are they?
JERRY: Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
JERRY: Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
JERRY: See I was saying six but she thought I was saying sex. We straightened the whole thing out though.
JERRY: See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
JERRY: See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
JERRY: See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
JERRY: See what?
JERRY: See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an I'm not sorry wave.
JERRY: See ya'.
JERRY: See ya.
JERRY: See ya.
JERRY: See ya.
JERRY: See you ... me and Kramer...
JERRY: See you later
JERRY: See you later. Well we cant all be dating podiatrists.
JERRY: See, again, I really don't feel that...
JERRY: See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
JERRY: See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
JERRY: See, its never as bad as you imagine.
JERRY: See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
JERRY: See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
JERRY: See, now that I don't care for.
JERRY: See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
JERRY: See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
JERRY: See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
JERRY: See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
JERRY: See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
JERRY: See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
JERRY: See?
JERRY: See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
JERRY: See? You give, and you get.
JERRY: Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
JERRY: Seems reasonable.
JERRY: Seen any good movies lately?
JERRY: Seeya.
JERRY: Seinfeld.
JERRY: Seinfeld.
JERRY: Seinfeld.
JERRY: Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
JERRY: Self-esteem?
JERRY: selling sexual pleasure over the phone?
JERRY: September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
JERRY: Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
JERRY: Seriously?
JERRY: Seven and five eighths
JERRY: Seven-eleven?
JERRY: Seven.
JERRY: Seven?
JERRY: Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
JERRY: Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
JERRY: Sex... to save the friendship. Well, if we have to we have to.
JERRY: Sexual?
JERRY: Shaft.
JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
JERRY: She asked about you.
JERRY: She broke up with you?
JERRY: She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was Beaches for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
JERRY: She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
JERRY: She coming of a bad break-up?
JERRY: She could be an 'it'.
JERRY: She could have mentioned the conversation.
JERRY: She could have.
JERRY: She couldn't make it.
JERRY: She did kind of touch my face.
JERRY: She did, you insisted.
JERRY: She did?
JERRY: She did?
JERRY: She didn't even want a napkin.
JERRY: She didn't stay over?
JERRY: She didn't touch it.
JERRY: She died.
JERRY: She died.
JERRY: She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?
JERRY: She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
JERRY: She does have a way.
JERRY: She does not.
JERRY: She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
JERRY: She doesn't have toe thumbs.
JERRY: She doesn't open...?
JERRY: She doesnt wanna borrow the money.
JERRY: She dumped you?
JERRY: She faked.
JERRY: She flipped out! Just left.
JERRY: She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
JERRY: She got the promotion?
JERRY: She had a good time.
JERRY: She had man-hands.
JERRY: She happy for you?
JERRY: She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
JERRY: She hasn't told her father yet?
JERRY: She is?
JERRY: She is?
JERRY: She knew that.
JERRY: She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
JERRY: She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
JERRY: She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
JERRY: She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.
JERRY: She likes him I mean she really likes him.
JERRY: She likes talking during sex.
JERRY: She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. He likes the pop-in, too.
JERRY: She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
JERRY: She lives with her parents.
JERRY: She looked great.
JERRY: She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
JERRY: She looks so familiar.
JERRY: She might be. She's the star of the show.
JERRY: She must be psychotic or something.
JERRY: She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
JERRY: She never sees the big picture.
JERRY: She reads lips.
JERRY: She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
JERRY: She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
JERRY: She said no?
JERRY: She said she'll do it.
JERRY: She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
JERRY: She said what?
JERRY: She saved your life?
JERRY: She says I suppress my emotions.
JERRY: She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... &gt;click click&lt; Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? &gt;click click&lt; I'm back...
JERRY: She says, uh..
JERRY: She seems very nice.
JERRY: She sees something in him.
JERRY: She should just give up.
JERRY: She suggested it!
JERRY: She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
JERRY: She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
JERRY: She thinks it's someone named Raef.
JERRY: She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
JERRY: She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
JERRY: She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
JERRY: She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
JERRY: She wants to be back on yours.
JERRY: She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
JERRY: She wants to talk.
JERRY: She was looking for someone to go to the show with.

JERRY: SHOT! I told ya! Yeah?
JERRY: Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
JERRY: Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?
JERRY: Should I?
JERRY: Should we walk him around?
JERRY: Shouldn't a doctor do it?

And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.

JERRY: So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... Look at that toe, buddy. I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?

JERRY: So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
JERRY: So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
JERRY: So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?

JERRY: Sure, dinner would be fine.
JERRY: Sure, fine with me.
JERRY: Sure, go ahead.
JERRY: Sure, how much?
JERRY: Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
JERRY: Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
JERRY: Sure, Saturday night.
JERRY: Sure, that would be great.

JERRY: Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. Her too.
JERRY: Svengali.
JERRY: Svenjolly.
JERRY: Swimming?
JERRY: Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
JERRY: Swirl.
JERRY: Swivel?
JERRY: T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
JERRY: Ta-da!
JERRY: Tails!

JERRY: Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
JERRY: Talkin' to Sidra?
JERRY: Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.
JERRY: Technically, you're sautéed. So, what are you doing for that?
JERRY: Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
JERRY: Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
JERRY: Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. What've you got in a push-button mini.
JERRY: Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
JERRY: Tell her what?
JERRY: Tell her you lost your itch.
JERRY: Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.
JERRY: Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
JERRY: Tell me about it!
JERRY: Tell me about it.
JERRY: Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
JERRY: Tell me what happened.
JERRY: Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
JERRY: Tell me what?
JERRY: Tell me what?
JERRY: Tell you something...I do.
JERRY: Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
JERRY: Ten minutes.
JERRY: Ten-thirty.
JERRY: Tennis, anyone?
JERRY: tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
JERRY: Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
JERRY: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
JERRY: Thank you for your cooperation.

JERRY: Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
JERRY: Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
JERRY: Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
JERRY: Thank you. Nice job.
JERRY: Thank you...
JERRY: thanks
JERRY: Thanks again.
JERRY: Thanks for having me over, guys.

JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.
JERRY: That Arabian is strong coffee.
JERRY: That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
JERRY: That bothered you?
JERRY: That close, huh?
JERRY: That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
JERRY: That doesn't make it right.
JERRY: That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
JERRY: That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
JERRY: That doesn't sound right.
JERRY: That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!
JERRY: That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
JERRY: That guy! Swarm! Swarm!
JERRY: That has nothing to do with it.
JERRY: THAT I heard.
JERRY: That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
JERRY: That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
JERRY: That is close.
JERRY: That is disgusting.
JERRY: That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
JERRY: That is one angry clown!
JERRY: That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. What are you doing today?
JERRY: That is out there.
JERRY: That is right, somebody else was driving.
JERRY: That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
JERRY: That is so Franco.
JERRY: That is the guy!
JERRY: That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
JERRY: That is worse.
JERRY: That looks pretty good.
JERRY: That madman is trying to kill me.
JERRY: That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
JERRY: That must be some book.
JERRY: That nut is always up to something.
JERRY: That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
JERRY: That old scam.
JERRY: That orange dress is burned in my memory
JERRY: That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!
JERRY: That seems about right.
JERRY: That smells good, what is that?
JERRY: That stinky old movie-house?
JERRY: That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
JERRY: That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
JERRY: That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back.
JERRY: That was a one in a million Mohel.
JERRY: That was an accident!
JERRY: That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
JERRY: That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
JERRY: That was double overtime.
JERRY: That was Elaine, she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
JERRY: That was Elaine...
JERRY: That was him?
JERRY: That was July 4th!
JERRY: That was Keith.
JERRY: That was our babka.
JERRY: That was our babka. We had that babka!
JERRY: That was something.
JERRY: That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
JERRY: That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
JERRY: That wasnt so bad, really.
JERRY: That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
JERRY: That woman is absolutely stunning.
JERRY: That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
JERRY: That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
JERRY: That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
JERRY: That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.
JERRY: That'd be the fleas.
JERRY: That's a 180, George.
JERRY: That's a date.
JERRY: That's a five.
JERRY: That's a good one. Dentists.
JERRY: That's a great place!
JERRY: That's a hell of a plan. Listen -
JERRY: That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
JERRY: That's a lot of skin.
JERRY: That's a massage.
JERRY: That's a nice four seconds.
JERRY: That's a shame.
JERRY: That's a shame.
JERRY: That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
JERRY: That's alright, I got it.
JERRY: That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
JERRY: That's an interesting package.
JERRY: That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
JERRY: That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
JERRY: That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
JERRY: That's because she had my mail.
JERRY: That's because you didn't win.
JERRY: That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
JERRY: That's disgusting.
JERRY: That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it.
JERRY: That's enough!
JERRY: That's enough!
JERRY: That's enough.
JERRY: That's enough.
JERRY: That's final!!!
JERRY: That's from the car!
JERRY: That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
JERRY: That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
JERRY: That's good stuff.
JERRY: That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
JERRY: That's good.
JERRY: That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
JERRY: That's great!
JERRY: That's great.
JERRY: That's him.
JERRY: That's him.
JERRY: That's how it's gonna be.
JERRY: That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
JERRY: That's incredible!
JERRY: That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
JERRY: That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
JERRY: That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
JERRY: That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
JERRY: That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
JERRY: That's it, you gave up?
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks.
JERRY: That's my car!
JERRY: That's my cockney accent.
JERRY: That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
JERRY: That's my ticket!
JERRY: That's my walkman!
JERRY: That's neat.
JERRY: That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great!
JERRY: That's nice for the freaks.
JERRY: That's nice of you to say.
JERRY: That's nice.
JERRY: That's nice.
JERRY: That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
JERRY: That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
JERRY: That's not a good role for you.
JERRY: That's not bad.
JERRY: That's not funny Naomi.
JERRY: That's not that?
JERRY: That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
JERRY: That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
JERRY: That's not what I do.
JERRY: That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
JERRY: That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
JERRY: That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
JERRY: That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
JERRY: That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
JERRY: That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
JERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
JERRY: That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
JERRY: That's right, I'm taking a dive.
JERRY: That's right, lady!
JERRY: That's right, the Bubble Boy.
JERRY: That's right, you let him have it.
JERRY: That's right.
JERRY: That's right. I bought it.
JERRY: That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
JERRY: That's right. You're emotional.
JERRY: That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...
JERRY: That's shocking, but sounds ...
JERRY: That's so funny!
JERRY: That's so strange.
JERRY: That's Step Ten?
JERRY: That's strange...
JERRY: That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
JERRY: That's terrible...
JERRY: That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
JERRY: That's the garbage disposal!
JERRY: That's the guy?
JERRY: That's the idea.
JERRY: That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
JERRY: That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
JERRY: That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
JERRY: That's the point.
JERRY: That's the rule.
JERRY: That's the spirit. You suck!
JERRY: That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. Ping, what happened?
JERRY: That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
JERRY: That's the way it works.
JERRY: That's the way they do it in Vegas.
JERRY: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life. Hey! Georgie boy, guess what I got.
JERRY: That's their policy.
JERRY: That's true.
JERRY: That's true.
JERRY: That's true.
JERRY: That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. Excuse me one second.
JERRY: That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
JERRY: That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
JERRY: That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
JERRY: That's very nice, I guess.
JERRY: That's very nice.
JERRY: That's were they got it from!
JERRY: That's what a gym teacher once told me.
JERRY: That's what I do with him
JERRY: That's what I thought.
JERRY: That's what I was thinking.
JERRY: That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
JERRY: That's what it costs!
JERRY: That's what she told me!
JERRY: That's what they get!
JERRY: That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
JERRY: That's what's so fascinating.
JERRY: That's why I poked.
JERRY: That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
JERRY: That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
JERRY: That's wonderful news. Thank you.
JERRY: That's your problem, you should be.
JERRY: That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
JERRY: That.
JERRY: That?
JERRY: That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
JERRY: Thats all there is to it.
JERRY: Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. Ray?
JERRY: Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
JERRY: Thats got nothin to do with it.
JERRY: Thats her! Shes here!
JERRY: Thats not necessary. You know, maybe its not that bad an idea.
JERRY: Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
JERRY: Thats perfect.
JERRY: Thats the bet! Hello?... No- oh, hi... no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
JERRY: Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
JERRY: Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
JERRY: Thats your big boy.
JERRY: The % thing to do is just not think about it.
JERRY: The *beach*?
JERRY: The actress?
JERRY: The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
JERRY: The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
JERRY: The apple pie you had today at Monks
JERRY: The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
JERRY: The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... The bad tipper!
JERRY: The bad fiancé&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
JERRY: The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on
JERRY: The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
JERRY: The baldies
JERRY: The bedroom!
JERRY: The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
JERRY: The big toe; The captain.
JERRY: The Bizarro coffeeshop?
JERRY: The black and white.
JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants!
JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
JERRY: The boom box incident?
JERRY: The botched it?
JERRY: The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
JERRY: The bris?
JERRY: The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
JERRY: The Bubble Boy? He lives around here?
JERRY: The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
JERRY: The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. Isn't it? You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa.
JERRY: The buzzer.
JERRY: The captain of the toes. Hello.
JERRY: The car!
JERRY: The Charlie Macarthy hearings.
JERRY: The Chinese, the Chinese bald cure.
JERRY: The chip-in!
JERRY: The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
JERRY: The cleaners? How did it get there?
JERRY: The Coast,
JERRY: The coffeeshop?
JERRY: The Collected Works Of Bette Midler.
JERRY: The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
JERRY: The coup dé-toe
JERRY: The crepe place?
JERRY: The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- How did you get in here?
JERRY: The Daily Worker has personal ads?
JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it: a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
JERRY: The Dentist?
JERRY: The dog. You're getting the dog.
JERRY: The dog?
JERRY: The dog? The dog??
JERRY: The door? You left the door open?
JERRY: The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
JERRY: The Drake is good!
JERRY: The Drake is great!
JERRY: The driver seems a little put out.
JERRY: The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
JERRY: The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
JERRY: The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
JERRY: The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
JERRY: The exact same outfit.
JERRY: The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
JERRY: The fabric of society is very complex George.
JERRY: The Fleckman.
JERRY: The fly-boy.
JERRY: The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
JERRY: The guy whos in the gulag?!
JERRY: The guy with the lizard.
JERRY: The guy?
JERRY: The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
JERRY: The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. Who was that clown?, I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?, The guy's a clown!. How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!
JERRY: The hospital?
JERRY: The Human Fund. Money for people.
JERRY: The Improv is playing Rochelle Rochelle The musical.
JERRY: The Inka-dink.. You were It.
JERRY: The Jerry's back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
JERRY: The jewel thief?
JERRY: The Jews?
JERRY: The Jujy Fruits?
JERRY: The Kavorka? Whats that?
JERRY: The lake isn't real.
JERRY: The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
JERRY: The main thing is to keep the line moving.
JERRY: The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
JERRY: The manager.
JERRY: The massages are out!
JERRY: The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
JERRY: The murderers!
JERRY: The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
JERRY: The New York Yankees?!
JERRY: The New Yorker?
JERRY: The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
JERRY: The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go how do you like crotch? If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
JERRY: The omelet. Damn.
JERRY: The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
JERRY: The one with the Poppie stain?!
JERRY: The one with the...
JERRY: The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
JERRY: The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
JERRY: The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
JERRY: The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
JERRY: The pick?
JERRY: The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know.
JERRY: The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
JERRY: The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
JERRY: The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
JERRY: The police?
JERRY: The poly?
JERRY: The Portuguese waitress?
JERRY: The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
JERRY: The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
JERRY: The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour. I'm confused.
JERRY: The religious guy?
JERRY: The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
JERRY: The rines are crossed?
JERRY: The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
JERRY: The Saab factory?
JERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
JERRY: The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
JERRY: The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
JERRY: The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
JERRY: The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
JERRY: The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
JERRY: The store.
JERRY: The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go Excuse me, I think you missed a spot.
JERRY: The Switch.
JERRY: The tap is tough.
JERRY: The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
JERRY: The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
JERRY: The third?
JERRY: The ticket is worthless.
JERRY: The timeless art of seduction.
JERRY: The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
JERRY: The Truth.
JERRY: The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
JERRY: The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
JERRY: the usual
JERRY: The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
JERRY: The Velvet fog?
JERRY: The virgin!
JERRY: The waiter was trembling!
JERRY: The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
JERRY: The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
JERRY: The washer fluid is fine.
JERRY: The way I feel when I go places with you? Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
JERRY: The wedding is off? What happened?
JERRY: The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
JERRY: The what??
JERRY: The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
JERRY: The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
JERRY: The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
JERRY: The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
JERRY: The whole system is breakin' down!
JERRY: The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
JERRY: The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. Thats probably Uncle Leo.
JERRY: The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
JERRY: The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
JERRY: The woman, she--
JERRY: The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
JERRY: The...black, leather...thing with a strap.
JERRY: Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
JERRY: Then can I have it back?
JERRY: Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
JERRY: Then he asked you out?
JERRY: Then how'd you get up there?
JERRY: Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
JERRY: Then it does exist.
JERRY: Then it was trash.
JERRY: Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
JERRY: Then that's the meal.
JERRY: Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
JERRY: Then we'll make it the eight.
JERRY: Then well just sit there.
JERRY: Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
JERRY: Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
JERRY: Then what was it?
JERRY: Then what'd you come down here for?
JERRY: Then what?
JERRY: Then who?
JERRY: Then you admit it was amusing?
JERRY: Then YOU would be hunched over.
JERRY: Then you're in a lot of trouble.
JERRY: Then, what was all that sniffing?
JERRY: Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
JERRY: There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
JERRY: there are no copies.
JERRY: There are ways.
JERRY: There he is. He's going into that bar.
JERRY: There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
JERRY: There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
JERRY: There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
JERRY: There isn't?
JERRY: There isn't?
JERRY: There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
JERRY: There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
JERRY: There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
JERRY: There must be some mistake.
JERRY: There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
JERRY: There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
JERRY: There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
JERRY: There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a Smell Gestapo. To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
JERRY: There should be more people like us.
JERRY: There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
JERRY: There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
JERRY: There was no mistaking it?
JERRY: There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
JERRY: There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
JERRY: There you are. Did you find him?
JERRY: There you go.
JERRY: There you go.
JERRY: There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
JERRY: There you go. That'll get you home in time.
JERRY: There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
JERRY: There's a g-spot.
JERRY: There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
JERRY: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
JERRY: There's a lot of change down there.
JERRY: There's a naked woman across the street.
JERRY: There's a squeeze ketchup.
JERRY: There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
JERRY: There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
JERRY: There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
JERRY: There's crepe money?
JERRY: There's George!
JERRY: There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
JERRY: There's more food down the hall.
JERRY: There's more than a couple.
JERRY: There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
JERRY: There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
JERRY: There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
JERRY: There's no precedent, baby!
JERRY: There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
JERRY: There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
JERRY: There's no Zorn or Zoutraph.
JERRY: There's none left?
JERRY: There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
JERRY: There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
JERRY: There's nothing subtle about that.
JERRY: There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
JERRY: There's nothing wrong with my career!
JERRY: There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
JERRY: There's really not that much to tell.
JERRY: There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
JERRY: There's Sidra.
JERRY: There's some hot air blowing in here..
JERRY: There's weather.
JERRY: There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
JERRY: There. Alright?
JERRY: There. So, how did it go?
JERRY: Theres a lot of people to mock...
JERRY: Theres more. The refrigerator.
JERRY: Theres no milk in here, what...
JERRY: Theres nothing to get.
JERRY: Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
JERRY: Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? George Costanza, please.
JERRY: Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
JERRY: These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
JERRY: These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
JERRY: These beans are pretty good.
JERRY: These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
JERRY: These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call!
JERRY: These pretzels are making me thirsty.
JERRY: These the people you currently live with?
JERRY: They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
JERRY: They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
JERRY: They could at least try it.
JERRY: They cross the wires or something.
JERRY: They deliver the coal?
JERRY: They deliver wood?
JERRY: They did it for three years. What's another few months.
JERRY: They did.
JERRY: They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
JERRY: They do have their own schools!
JERRY: They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
JERRY: They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
JERRY: They eat fish.
JERRY: They get all emotional, they sway. It's embarrassing.
JERRY: They got away.
JERRY: They got some sort of program.
JERRY: They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
JERRY: They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
JERRY: They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
JERRY: They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
JERRY: They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
JERRY: They have gotten to know you.
JERRY: They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
JERRY: They just took Susan to the Hospital
JERRY: They just wanted the armoire?
JERRY: They know how to make 'em...
JERRY: They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
JERRY: They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. What do they look like.
JERRY: They lost.
JERRY: They make wigs out of human hairs?
JERRY: They nailed you on the 20 G's?
JERRY: They really should mention that in the breakdown: height, weight, goiter.
JERRY: They really stick to that understudy rule.
JERRY: They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
JERRY: They said they were interested in me.
JERRY: They say, What's your show about? I say, Nothing.
JERRY: They sealed him up with the mint inside.
JERRY: They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
JERRY: They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
JERRY: They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
JERRY: They still do that play?
JERRY: They stole my car.
JERRY: They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
JERRY: They were all like that!
JERRY: They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
JERRY: They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
JERRY: They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
JERRY: They'll give us water in there.
JERRY: They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
JERRY: They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
JERRY: They're busting this guy.
JERRY: They're closed.
JERRY: They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
JERRY: They're Cuban cigar rollers.
JERRY: They're doing an incredible business.
JERRY: They're hands!
JERRY: They're having sex in the hotel room.
JERRY: They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
JERRY: They're looking.
JERRY: They're making these?
JERRY: They're musicians. That's not a joke.

JERRY: They're not letting me in.
JERRY: They're not making higher roofs.
JERRY: They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
JERRY: They're nuts with temperature.
JERRY: They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
JERRY: They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
JERRY: They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
JERRY: They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
JERRY: They're the worst.
JERRY: They're uncomfortable.
JERRY: They've gotta be kidding.
JERRY: They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
JERRY: They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
JERRY: Theyre a comedy team.
JERRY: Thin ice, George. Thin ice..
JERRY: Things are good?
JERRY: think I've changed my mind.
JERRY: Think of me as a doctor.
JERRY: Think she wants those clubs.
JERRY: Think so?
JERRY: Thirteen thousand.
JERRY: This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
JERRY: This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
JERRY: This could be an emergency!
JERRY: This could only happen to you.
JERRY: This friendship: Its not working.
JERRY: This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
JERRY: This guy's belching out vitamins..
JERRY: This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
JERRY: This has 'international incident' written all over it.
JERRY: This is a new one.
JERRY: This is a nightmare.
JERRY: This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.
JERRY: This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
JERRY: This is a, Bob Cobb.
JERRY: This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
JERRY: This is amazing, you can't believe this!
JERRY: This is amazing.
JERRY: This is Amy.
JERRY: This is an emergency, what's taking so long? Wait a second, maybe that's them. Hello?
JERRY: This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
JERRY: This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
JERRY: This is brutal.
JERRY: This is Elaine Benes.
JERRY: This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
JERRY: This is Gary.
JERRY: This is George, this is Kramer.
JERRY: This is going to be a shame.
JERRY: This is gonna be great!
JERRY: This is gonna to be ugly.
JERRY: This is horrible! I care!
JERRY: This is how you operate?
JERRY: This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
JERRY: this is Jane Elaine
JERRY: This is Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: This is Laura.
JERRY: This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
JERRY: This is Lois.
JERRY: This is my friend George.
JERRY: This is my friend George.
JERRY: This is nice.
JERRY: This is Nikki.
JERRY: This is no good.
JERRY: This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
JERRY: This is not a good time.
JERRY: This is Outrageous! Pack of Juicy Fruit.
JERRY: This is quite a condo.
JERRY: This is real believable.
JERRY: This is really too much.
JERRY: This is really weird..
JERRY: This is ridiculous.
JERRY: This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
JERRY: This is some FINE mutton.
JERRY: This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
JERRY: This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
JERRY: This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
JERRY: This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
JERRY: This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
JERRY: This is too much.
JERRY: This is unbelievable.
JERRY: This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
JERRY: This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
JERRY: This is what you gonna wear?
JERRY: THIS is your hiding place?!
JERRY: This is your plan?
JERRY: This is your son?
JERRY: This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
JERRY: This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
JERRY: This old thing?
JERRY: This one?
JERRY: This puddle on my sofa!
JERRY: This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
JERRY: This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
JERRY: This thing has never worked right.
JERRY: This was your idea!
JERRY: This Wednesday?
JERRY: This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
JERRY: This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
JERRY: This woman's completely ignoring me.
JERRY: This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
JERRY: This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!
JERRY: This?
JERRY: Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
JERRY: Those belong to people.
JERRY: Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
JERRY: Those damn 'I love you' returns.
JERRY: Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
JERRY: Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, .
JERRY: Those two?
JERRY: Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
JERRY: Thousand.
JERRY: Three.
JERRY: Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
JERRY: Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
JERRY: Tic-Tacs work?
JERRY: Tim Whatley?
JERRY: Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
JERRY: Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
JERRY: Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
JERRY: Tina Turner?
JERRY: Tippy Toe? I dont think so.
JERRY: To a children's charity!
JERRY: To a guy you've never met? Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
JERRY: To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
JERRY: to basically give this money away-
JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!
JERRY: To Latvian Orthodox?
JERRY: To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, How ya doin'? Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow Hey You start coming up with nicknames for them. Jimbo.
JERRY: To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch. According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
JERRY: To our future wives....yeah...
JERRY: To see a movie.
JERRY: To spite my parents?
JERRY: To the door?
JERRY: To the Idiotmobile!
JERRY: To the Laundromat.
JERRY: To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
JERRY: To the right.
JERRY: to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
JERRY: To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
JERRY: To wit
JERRY: Today's not cold.
JERRY: Today's not my birthday.
JERRY: Today, like right now.
JERRY: Today, right now! Are you in?
JERRY: Todd. Oh yeah. He's a Kennedy.
JERRY: Toilet brush, oh . Alright, I can replace that.
JERRY: Toilet paper's changed.
JERRY: Toilet paper?
JERRY: Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
JERRY: Told you.
JERRY: Tomorrow afternoon?
JERRY: Tongue?
JERRY: Tonight.
JERRY: Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
JERRY: Tonight?
JERRY: Tony, hey hey
JERRY: Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
JERRY: Tony, where are you?
JERRY: Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
JERRY: Tony.
JERRY: Too bad.
JERRY: Too bad.
JERRY: Too bad. It was erotic.
JERRY: Too domestic.
JERRY: Too dumb?
JERRY: Too good.
JERRY: Too Gubernatorial.
JERRY: Too late for that.
JERRY: Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
JERRY: Too romantic.
JERRY: Too sexual.
JERRY: Too thin?
JERRY: Tough day at the office?
JERRY: Tough one. You're call.
JERRY: Towards what end?
JERRY: Tractor!
JERRY: Transfer?
JERRY: Tremendous girl.
JERRY: Trip to Berlin?
JERRY: Tropic of Cancer.
JERRY: Tropic of Capricorn?
JERRY: Trouble
JERRY: Trouble down at the plant?
JERRY: True. You mean, for you?
JERRY: Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
JERRY: Trust me, you're off.
JERRY: trust me.. nah it's good
JERRY: Try Elaine.
JERRY: Try me.
JERRY: Try to.
JERRY: Tub is love.
JERRY: Tuberculosis
JERRY: Tuberculosis
JERRY: Tuck in, tuck in.
JERRY: Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
JERRY: Tunisia?
JERRY: Turn around, George.
JERRY: Turn in?
JERRY: Turn up the heat in your apartment!
JERRY: TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
JERRY: Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
JERRY: Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. I saw that.
JERRY: Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
JERRY: Two Forty-Five.
JERRY: Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
JERRY: Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
JERRY: Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
JERRY: Two minutes.
JERRY: Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
JERRY: Two o clock.
JERRY: Two pair? Three of a kind?
JERRY: Two seconds. Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
JERRY: Two.
JERRY: Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
JERRY: Typical things.
JERRY: U-oh come on up. It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
JERRY: Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
JERRY: Ugh.
JERRY: Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
JERRY: Uh - new car!

JERRY: Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye
JERRY: Uh huh
JERRY: Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
JERRY: Uh huh, what's that?
JERRY: Uh huh.
JERRY: Uh huh.
JERRY: Uh huh.
JERRY: Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
JERRY: Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
JERRY: Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
JERRY: Uh huh...
JERRY: Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.
JERRY: Uh huh?
JERRY: Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
JERRY: Uh Laura, George was wondering if...
JERRY: Uh oh.
JERRY: Uh oh.
JERRY: uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
JERRY: Uh! Really .That's nice.
JERRY: Uh, again? I'll be right there.
JERRY: Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
JERRY: Uh, alright.
JERRY: Uh, bathroom.
JERRY: Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
JERRY: Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
JERRY: Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
JERRY: Uh, friend of a friend. And you?
JERRY: Uh, good.
JERRY: Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
JERRY: Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
JERRY: Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
JERRY: Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
JERRY: Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
JERRY: Uh, Huh, yeah.
JERRY: Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.
JERRY: Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
JERRY: Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
JERRY: Uh, I don't think so.
JERRY: Uh, JFK. I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
JERRY: Uh, just my next door neighbor.
JERRY: Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
JERRY: Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
JERRY: Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
JERRY: Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
JERRY: Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye.
JERRY: Uh, next week.
JERRY: Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
JERRY: Uh, no, he's taking the car.
JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.
JERRY: Uh, no. Should I have?
JERRY: Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.
JERRY: Uh, one second.
JERRY: Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men

JERRY: Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.
JERRY: Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.

JERRY: Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door
JERRY: Uh, this is George. Im sorry...
JERRY: Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
JERRY: uh, well I can't help you there .
JERRY: Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
JERRY: Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
JERRY: Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . .
JERRY: Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
JERRY: Uh, well. It, uh...
JERRY: Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. Now this is a good looking booth.
JERRY: Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do.
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. Alright, look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
JERRY: Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
JERRY: Uh, yeah. Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
JERRY: Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
JERRY: Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
JERRY: Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
JERRY: Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
JERRY: Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
JERRY: Uh-huh, yeah.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Uh-huh.

JERRY: Uh-oh... What do we have here?
JERRY: Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
JERRY: Uh.. one of the three tenors.
JERRY: Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
JERRY: Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
JERRY: Uh... may I help you?
JERRY: Uh...I got married.
JERRY: Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
JERRY: Uh?
JERRY: Uhh, I don't think so.
JERRY: Uhh...
JERRY: Uhm, hold, hold on a second. I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
JERRY: Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
JERRY: Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
JERRY: Um hum.
JERRY: Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
JERRY: Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
JERRY: Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
JERRY: Um, I don't even know?
JERRY: Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
JERRY: Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
JERRY: Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
JERRY: Um, who do I make it out to?
JERRY: Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
JERRY: Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away.
JERRY: Um. I'll call you back ok?
JERRY: Uma Therman? Really?
JERRY: Unbelievable!
JERRY: Unbelievable! She's not there.
JERRY: Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
JERRY: Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
JERRY: Uncle Leo!
JERRY: Uncle Leo!
JERRY: Uncle Leo! Alright! Take it!
JERRY: Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
JERRY: Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
JERRY: Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?
JERRY: Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
JERRY: Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
JERRY: Uncle Leo, wait!
JERRY: Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
JERRY: Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Uncle Leo. Hello!
JERRY: Uncle Leo?
JERRY: Uncle Leo?
JERRY: Uncle Leo?!
JERRY: Uncle Leo?!
JERRY: Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
JERRY: UNDATEABLE!
JERRY: Under arrest? What for?
JERRY: Under the sofa cushion.
JERRY: Understand you had a little talk with him too.
JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
JERRY: Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
JERRY: Unless you're married.
JERRY: Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
JERRY: Up state! Hummm.
JERRY: Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
JERRY: Use it in a sentence.
JERRY: Used?
JERRY: Uugh! Ahh.
JERRY: Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
JERRY: Valerie's not coming over, is she?
JERRY: Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
JERRY: Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
JERRY: Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
JERRY: Vaya con dios.
JERRY: Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
JERRY: Vermont! With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. What? What is this?
JERRY: Very funny.
JERRY: Very good
JERRY: Very good looking.
JERRY: Very handsome.
JERRY: Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
JERRY: Very nice, very nice, nice.
JERRY: Very strange.
JERRY: Very tasty.
JERRY: Volcano? Really?
JERRY: Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
JERRY: Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
JERRY: W-w-wha' you got in there?
JERRY: W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
JERRY: W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
JERRY: W-what do you mean?
JERRY: Wa, it's two weeks old.
JERRY: Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
JERRY: Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
JERRY: Wait a minute!
JERRY: Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
JERRY: Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
JERRY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
JERRY: Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
JERRY: Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?
JERRY: Wait a second!
JERRY: Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
JERRY: Wait a second, don't you--
JERRY: Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
JERRY: Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
JERRY: Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
JERRY: Wait a second, I--
JERRY: Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
JERRY: Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
JERRY: Wait a second, whats going on here?
JERRY: Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
JERRY: Wait a second. *My* move?
JERRY: Wait a second. .Just give me a second
JERRY: Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
JERRY: Wait a second. This'll scare 'em off. Well, good night, Ollie.
JERRY: Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
JERRY: Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
JERRY: Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
JERRY: Wait a second... wait a second!! The letter, that's the letter!
JERRY: Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
JERRY: Wait'll you get to know him.
JERRY: Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
JERRY: Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
JERRY: Wait, I got another call. That must be him. Hello?
JERRY: Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that.
JERRY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
JERRY: Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
JERRY: wait, where are you going? where are you going?
JERRY: Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
JERRY: Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
JERRY: Wait. How does Horneck know you?
JERRY: Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!
JERRY: Walk away?
JERRY: Walk me down to the Friars.
JERRY: Walked right over to her table.
JERRY: Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
JERRY: Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
JERRY: Was he out there?
JERRY: Was I supposed to bring something?
JERRY: Was it apple?
JERRY: Was it eaten?
JERRY: Was it in the trash?
JERRY: Was it pimple popper MD?
JERRY: Was there a red-headed guy there?
JERRY: Wavy.
JERRY: Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
JERRY: We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
JERRY: We are dead.
JERRY: We better not. T-They're gonna be here any second.
JERRY: We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
JERRY: We can only thank God for that.
JERRY: We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
JERRY: We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
JERRY: We come from the same place.
JERRY: We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
JERRY: We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
JERRY: We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
JERRY: We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
JERRY: We could talk.
JERRY: We could visit together!
JERRY: We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
JERRY: We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
JERRY: We do what we can.
JERRY: We don't hear that.
JERRY: We don't know!
JERRY: We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
JERRY: We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
JERRY: We dont have two seconds?
JERRY: We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
JERRY: We found out his super power was lack of money.
JERRY: We got along beautifully.
JERRY: We gotta confess.
JERRY: We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
JERRY: We had a little fight this afternoon. Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
JERRY: WE HAD A PACT!!!
JERRY: We had quite a little chat.
JERRY: We had that babka.
JERRY: We have an appointment!
JERRY: We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
JERRY: We have time.
JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
JERRY: We haven't spoken.
JERRY: We just met.
JERRY: We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
JERRY: We made plans.
JERRY: We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
JERRY: We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
JERRY: We need you there!
JERRY: We should get him something.
JERRY: We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? George?
JERRY: We split it.
JERRY: We thought he was with you.
JERRY: We used to come in every day.
JERRY: We went over that.
JERRY: We were just playin.'
JERRY: We were right on the border.
JERRY: We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
JERRY: We were ten.
JERRY: We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
JERRY: We won't ruin the friendship.
JERRY: We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
JERRY: We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
JERRY: We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
JERRY: We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.
JERRY: We'll always have...pancakes.
JERRY: We'll be fine, what did she say?
JERRY: We'll be funny.
JERRY: We'll be outside
JERRY: We'll call him...
JERRY: We'll come to work with you.
JERRY: We'll eat it in the movie.
JERRY: We'll get a ride.
JERRY: We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
JERRY: We'll pull up another chair.
JERRY: We'll see about that. Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
JERRY: We'll see ya.
JERRY: We'll see you later.
JERRY: We'll see.
JERRY: We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
JERRY: We'll still make the movie.
JERRY: We'll take 'em!
JERRY: We'll take a check please.
JERRY: We're acting.
JERRY: We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
JERRY: We're already in a hospital.
JERRY: We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!
JERRY: We're both living with our parents.
JERRY: We're dead.
JERRY: We're doing fine. How are you?
JERRY: We're doing sixty miles an hour!
JERRY: We're even.
JERRY: we're expected to be superficial
JERRY: We're four months apart.
JERRY: We're getting vasectomies.
JERRY: We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
JERRY: We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
JERRY: We're going to Atlantic City.
JERRY: We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
JERRY: We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.

JERRY: We're gonna change the system.
JERRY: We're gonna have to talk about this later. Thank you. Taxi!
JERRY: We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
JERRY: We're having the intervention for Richie.
JERRY: We're here discussing our script with your father.
JERRY: We're in the middle of a discussion here.
JERRY: We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
JERRY: We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
JERRY: We're not gettin' that TV.
JERRY: We're not leaving the car!
JERRY: We're only kidding!
JERRY: We're pretty sure.
JERRY: We're straightening out!
JERRY: We're talkin' federal crime here.
JERRY: We're talking about people, right?
JERRY: We're talking.
JERRY: We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
JERRY: We're? What do you mean, We're?
JERRY: We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
JERRY: We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
JERRY: We've got to talk about this
JERRY: We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
JERRY: We? No.
JERRY: We? Since when are you a writer?
JERRY: Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
JERRY: Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?
JERRY: Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.
JERRY: Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
JERRY: Welcome back to the show.
JERRY: Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
JERRY: well
JERRY: Well ... ok, I guess
JERRY: Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
JERRY: Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
JERRY: well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
JERRY: Well at breakfast everybody reads.
JERRY: Well at least you and I are okay again.
JERRY: Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
JERRY: Well Biff/ What's next?
JERRY: Well Cindy, the place looks great.
JERRY: Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
JERRY: Well do you feel anything?
JERRY: Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
JERRY: Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
JERRY: Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
JERRY: Well George is an idiot.
JERRY: Well good night.
JERRY: Well goody for you.
JERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
JERRY: Well he doesn't even want himself there.
JERRY: Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance.
JERRY: Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
JERRY: Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
JERRY: Well he's kind of modest.
JERRY: Well Hello..
JERRY: Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
JERRY: Well how are you going.....
JERRY: Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
JERRY: Well how long you are going to keep this up?
JERRY: Well I can see it.
JERRY: Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
JERRY: Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
JERRY: Well I do.
JERRY: Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
JERRY: Well I don't know if I ...
JERRY: Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
JERRY: Well I don't want to take too much off.
JERRY: Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
JERRY: Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
JERRY: Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
JERRY: Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
JERRY: Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
JERRY: Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
JERRY: Well I started screaming, There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina. Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
JERRY: Well I started to go under...
JERRY: Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
JERRY: Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
JERRY: Well I think I get the gist of it.
JERRY: Well I think that's pretty obvious.
JERRY: Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
JERRY: Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
JERRY: Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
JERRY: Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
JERRY: Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
JERRY: Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, Gone.
JERRY: Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
JERRY: Well I'll get them.
JERRY: Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
JERRY: Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
JERRY: Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
JERRY: Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
JERRY: Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
JERRY: Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
JERRY: Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
JERRY: Well I, if it's your day off I really...
JERRY: Well I...
JERRY: Well I...
JERRY: Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.
JERRY: Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
JERRY: Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
JERRY: Well if he's going then I'm not going.
JERRY: Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
JERRY: Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
JERRY: Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
JERRY: Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
JERRY: Well it was my idea.
JERRY: Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
JERRY: Well it's gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania.
JERRY: Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestlé's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
JERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
JERRY: Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
JERRY: Well it's not tragic.
JERRY: Well it's probably just easier to say water cooler show than coffee machine show.
JERRY: well it's too much, it's embarrassing
JERRY: Well it's very emasculating..
JERRY: Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
JERRY: Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
JERRY: Well Im glad it's working out.
JERRY: Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
JERRY: Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
JERRY: Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
JERRY: Well Lisi, that was another-
JERRY: Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
JERRY: Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
JERRY: Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
JERRY: well maybe she couldn't spare it
JERRY: Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
JERRY: Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
JERRY: Well maybe they were here from before.
JERRY: Well my friend, it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
JERRY: Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
JERRY: Well not technically.
JERRY: Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
JERRY: Well now you know how I feel.
JERRY: Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
JERRY: Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
JERRY: Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
JERRY: Well six and sex are close.
JERRY: Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
JERRY: Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
JERRY: Well thank you very much, it's about time.
JERRY: Well that was really fun, thanks.
JERRY: Well that's a start.
JERRY: Well that's all I got.
JERRY: Well that's what's important.
JERRY: Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!
JERRY: Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
JERRY: Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
JERRY: Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
JERRY: Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
JERRY: Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
JERRY: Well they do work on tips.
JERRY: Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
JERRY: Well this is interesting.
JERRY: Well this is it.
JERRY: Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
JERRY: Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
JERRY: Well this is very awkward.
JERRY: Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
JERRY: Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
JERRY: Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
JERRY: well three years is a long time to be married.
JERRY: Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that.
JERRY: Well turn the light on...
JERRY: Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
JERRY: Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
JERRY: Well we saw you come in.
JERRY: Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
JERRY: Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ...
JERRY: Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
JERRY: Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. What brings you here?
JERRY: Well wh..wh.what are you doing?
JERRY: Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
JERRY: Well what about her?
JERRY: Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
JERRY: Well what about me?
JERRY: Well what about the week after?
JERRY: Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
JERRY: Well what am I going to tell Alex?
JERRY: Well what am I supposed to do now?
JERRY: Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
JERRY: Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
JERRY: Well what do girls do ?
JERRY: Well what do you suggest?
JERRY: Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
JERRY: Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
JERRY: Well what does this mean?
JERRY: Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
JERRY: Well what happened?
JERRY: Well what is it?
JERRY: Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
JERRY: Well what'd you mean?
JERRY: Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
JERRY: Well why are you going?
JERRY: Well why doesn't he just come in?
JERRY: Well why don't you say it?
JERRY: Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
JERRY: Well women do it.
JERRY: Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
JERRY: Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
JERRY: Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
JERRY: Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
JERRY: Well you gotta call your parents.
JERRY: Well you have insurance...
JERRY: Well you have to.
JERRY: Well you implied it.
JERRY: Well you know what this means, don't you?
JERRY: Well you might as well look it over.
JERRY: Well you said they could come and take the records.
JERRY: Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
JERRY: Well you should tell her.
JERRY: Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away: Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
JERRY: Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
JERRY: Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
JERRY: Well you'd be naked of course.
JERRY: Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
JERRY: Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
JERRY: Well you're not Lois Lane.
JERRY: Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
JERRY: Well you've really built yourself up into something.
JERRY: Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
JERRY: Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
JERRY: Well, ...
JERRY: Well, ...
JERRY: Well, a law's a law.
JERRY: Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
JERRY: Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
JERRY: Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
JERRY: Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
JERRY: Well, after he bit my friend--
JERRY: Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
JERRY: Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
JERRY: Well, ah.. What? Kind of like this?
JERRY: Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
JERRY: Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
JERRY: Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
JERRY: Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman: anything you say she does!
JERRY: Well, as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
JERRY: Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
JERRY: Well, at least have some reaction to it.
JERRY: Well, at least he didn't-
JERRY: Well, at least taste it.
JERRY: Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
JERRY: Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
JERRY: Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
JERRY: Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
JERRY: Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
JERRY: Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
JERRY: Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
JERRY: Well, break a leg tonight.
JERRY: Well, break a leg.
JERRY: Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
JERRY: Well, Clyde might not tell him.
JERRY: Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
JERRY: Well, communism didn't work.
JERRY: Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
JERRY: Well, did you get the ball?
JERRY: Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
JERRY: Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
JERRY: Well, either you see him or you don't.
JERRY: Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
JERRY: Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
JERRY: Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
JERRY: Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
JERRY: Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa  Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
JERRY: Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
JERRY: Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
JERRY: Well, frankly it is.
JERRY: Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
JERRY: Well, Gail Cunningham.
JERRY: Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
JERRY: Well, George doesn't think $13, 000 is enough money.
JERRY: Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
JERRY: Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
JERRY: Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
JERRY: Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
JERRY: Well, good night
JERRY: Well, Guatamala...
JERRY: Well, guess I'll get going.
JERRY: Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
JERRY: Well, he cant kill me, right?
JERRY: Well, he flinched, sort of.
JERRY: Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
JERRY: Well, he was wrong.
JERRY: Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
JERRY: Well, her belly button is like a mouth. Im bored. Talk to me.
JERRY: Well, here we are.
JERRY: Well, here we are...
JERRY: Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
JERRY: Well, how come?
JERRY: Well, how else could this have happened?
JERRY: Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
JERRY: Well, how much are you going to invest?
JERRY: Well, I . . .
JERRY: Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
JERRY: Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
JERRY: Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
JERRY: Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... Mulva!
JERRY: Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
JERRY: Well, I cant wear it.
JERRY: Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
JERRY: Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
JERRY: Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
JERRY: Well, I did the best I could.
JERRY: Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
JERRY: Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
JERRY: Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
JERRY: Well, I didn't sleep with her.
JERRY: Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
JERRY: Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
JERRY: Well, I didnt...
JERRY: Well, I do.
JERRY: Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
JERRY: Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
JERRY: Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
JERRY: Well, I don't know if I....
JERRY: Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
JERRY: Well, I don't normally--
JERRY: Well, I don't think I want to date a protégé whose mentor is a Costanza.
JERRY: Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
JERRY: Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
JERRY: Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
JERRY: Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
JERRY: Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
JERRY: Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
JERRY: Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
JERRY: Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
JERRY: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
JERRY: Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
JERRY: Well, I got to talk her out of this.
JERRY: Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
JERRY: Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
JERRY: Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
JERRY: Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
JERRY: Well, I guess I have no choice.
JERRY: Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
JERRY: Well, I guess we'll be going..
JERRY: Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
JERRY: Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
JERRY: Well, I have some money. What do you need?
JERRY: Well, I have this neighbor...
JERRY: Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
JERRY: Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
JERRY: Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
JERRY: Well, I just wanted to... You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
JERRY: Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
JERRY: Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
JERRY: Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
JERRY: Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
JERRY: Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
JERRY: Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
JERRY: Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
JERRY: Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
JERRY: Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching
JERRY: Well, I still think it's wrong.
JERRY: Well, I take it very seriously.
JERRY: Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
JERRY: Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
JERRY: Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. Hey, what about this one?
JERRY: Well, I think the whole thing stinks.
JERRY: Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
JERRY: Well, I think you're wrong.
JERRY: Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. Did you?
JERRY: Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
JERRY: Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
JERRY: Well, I want those keys.
JERRY: Well, I want to sit down.
JERRY: Well, I was here, thats everyone .
JERRY: Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
JERRY: Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
JERRY: Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
JERRY: Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
JERRY: Well, I'll think about it...
JERRY: Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
JERRY: Well, I'm a prospective member.
JERRY: Well, I'm calling this off right now.
JERRY: Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up.
JERRY: Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
JERRY: Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
JERRY: Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
JERRY: Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
JERRY: Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
JERRY: Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
JERRY: Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
JERRY: Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
JERRY: Well, I'm great.
JERRY: Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
JERRY: Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
JERRY: Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
JERRY: Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
JERRY: Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
JERRY: Well, I'm not telling you.
JERRY: Well, I'm not.
JERRY: Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
JERRY: Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
JERRY: Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
JERRY: Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
JERRY: Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.
JERRY: Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
JERRY: Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. A lot of women find that attractive.
JERRY: Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
JERRY: Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
JERRY: Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
JERRY: Well, I...
JERRY: Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
JERRY: Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
JERRY: Well, if I hear an anguished oink, I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look Human, human, human... Wait a second!
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
JERRY: Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
JERRY: Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
JERRY: Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
JERRY: Well, if that's not that, what is that?
JERRY: Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
JERRY: Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
JERRY: Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
JERRY: Well, is Elaine here?
JERRY: Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
JERRY: Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
JERRY: Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
JERRY: Well, it has nothing to do with you.
JERRY: Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
JERRY: Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
JERRY: Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
JERRY: Well, it was nice meeting you.
JERRY: Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
JERRY: Well, it was sudden.
JERRY: Well, it was that woman across the street. You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next.
JERRY: Well, it was the best of those movies.
JERRY: Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
JERRY: Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
JERRY: Well, it's a spider.
JERRY: Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
JERRY: Well, it's been a great visit.
JERRY: Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as Donna Chang...
JERRY: Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy.
JERRY: Well, it's kinda silly, but..
JERRY: Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
JERRY: Well, it's not about nothing.
JERRY: Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.
JERRY: Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
JERRY: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
JERRY: Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
JERRY: Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
JERRY: Well, it's something to consider.
JERRY: Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
JERRY: Well, its a first visit.
JERRY: Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
JERRY: Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
JERRY: Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
JERRY: Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?
JERRY: Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
JERRY: Well, just get it down.
JERRY: Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
JERRY: Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
JERRY: Well, keep looking.
JERRY: Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. I never should have cashed those checks!
JERRY: Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
JERRY: Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
JERRY: Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
JERRY: Well, let's confront 'em.
JERRY: Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
JERRY: Well, let's start the insanity.
JERRY: Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
JERRY: Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
JERRY: Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners. This is not his first load.
JERRY: Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out.
JERRY: Well, looks are so subjective.
JERRY: Well, maybe he doesn't have a get outta here kind of personality.
JERRY: Well, maybe he's --
JERRY: Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
JERRY: Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
JERRY: Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
JERRY: Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
JERRY: Well, maybe it's a good thing.
JERRY: Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
JERRY: Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
JERRY: Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
JERRY: Well, maybe she was disconnected.
JERRY: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
JERRY: Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
JERRY: Well, maybe we should.
JERRY: Well, maybe your refrigerator...
JERRY: Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
JERRY: Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
JERRY: Well, no, I'm not one of those.
JERRY: Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.
JERRY: Well, nobody sees the... cover.
JERRY: Well, not exactly.
JERRY: Well, now I'm engaged..
JERRY: Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
JERRY: Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
JERRY: Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
JERRY: Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!
JERRY: Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
JERRY: Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 9:00 oclock, that was pretty rough. Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
JERRY: Well, one cannot help What is going on?
JERRY: Well, she obviously liked you all along.
JERRY: Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
JERRY: Well, we gotta get it washed ....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
JERRY: Well, where is it?.
JERRY: Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
JERRY: Well...........you know.....
JERRY: Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
JERRY: What about the label maker?
JERRY: What about the Velvet Fog ?
JERRY: What are we gonna do?
JERRY: What are ya gonna do?
JERRY: What are you doing that for, you got a job
JERRY: What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
JERRY: What are you gonna do about the roommate?
JERRY: What are you gonna do?
JERRY: What did you say?
JERRY: What did you say?
JERRY: What do you mean, you got it?
JERRY: What do you say to a person like you?
JERRY: What do you think?
JERRY: What do you want?
JERRY: What does he look like?
JERRY: What does that mean, good dip?
JERRY: What is all this?
JERRY: What is goin' on in there?
JERRY: What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
JERRY: What is going on out there?
JERRY: What is going on?
JERRY: What is he doing in the Chunnel?
JERRY: What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
JERRY: What is he like?
JERRY: What is his name?
JERRY: What is his stand...on abortion?
JERRY: What is it she think you can't do?
JERRY: What is it that isn't working?
JERRY: What is it your business?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What is she making?
JERRY: What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
JERRY: What is so funny?
JERRY: What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
JERRY: What is that anyway?
JERRY: What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
JERRY: What is that music?
JERRY: What is that noise?
JERRY: What is that smell?
JERRY: What is that smell?
JERRY: What is that smell?
JERRY: What is that song?
JERRY: What is that sound?
JERRY: What is that stench? I got it. Ah hah.
JERRY: What is that, a 12 gauge?
JERRY: What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
JERRY: What is that, anyway?
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: What is the big deal?
JERRY: What is the complication?
JERRY: What is the difference?
JERRY: What is the matter with you?
JERRY: What is the point of all this?
JERRY: What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
JERRY: What is this about?
JERRY: What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
JERRY: What is this thing around your neck?
JERRY: What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: What is this? .
JERRY: What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
JERRY: What is with that?!
JERRY: What is with this thing.
JERRY: What is wrong?!
JERRY: What is your problem?
JERRY: What kind do you use?
JERRY: What kind of company is it?
JERRY: What kind of look?
JERRY: What kind of pen is that?
JERRY: What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
JERRY: What kind of pie are you cooking?
JERRY: What kind of pills are these, anyways?! For Smuckers? May cause panting and loss of fur? These are dog pills!
JERRY: What kind of plans?

JERRY: Whatever.
JERRY: Whatley.
JERRY: Whattya mean?
JERRY: Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
JERRY: Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.

JERRY: When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
JERRY: When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
JERRY: When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.

JERRY: When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
JERRY: When's he leaving?
JERRY: Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on
JERRY: Where am I going to look?

It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate?

JERRY: Why? He's harmless.
JERRY: Why? I'll tell you why.
JERRY: Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
JERRY: Why? Is that what he told you?
JERRY: Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
JERRY: Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
JERRY: Why? It's our place.
JERRY: Why? Well what are you doing?
JERRY: Why? What did I do?
JERRY: Why? What happened?

JERRY: Without Elaine? What for?
JERRY: Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
JERRY: Wizards!
JERRY: Woah.
JERRY: Women aren't like us.
JERRY: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
JERRY: Women go bald?
JERRY: Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
JERRY: Wonder about what?
JERRY: Wood is good.
JERRY: Woodhaven.
JERRY: World War I plane?
JERRY: World's collide.

JERRY: Would you get the Hell out of here!
JERRY: Would you give him the TV back?
JERRY: Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
JERRY: Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
JERRY: Would you like something to drink?
JERRY: Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
JERRY: Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
JERRY: Would you please stop saying that?!
JERRY: Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car.
JERRY: Would you stop?
JERRY: Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
JERRY: Would you tell Susan about it?
JERRY: Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
JERRY: Would you?

JERRY: Would. Does. Is.
JERRY: wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
JERRY: Wouldn't tune in.
JERRY: Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?

JERRY: Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
JERRY: Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
JERRY: Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
JERRY: Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. Um, its for you.
JERRY: Yeah, here.
JERRY: Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
JERRY: Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. I know, I know. Its down again.
JERRY: Yeah, how about a mute?
JERRY: Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
JERRY: Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.
JERRY: Yeah, I did that too.
JERRY: Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
JERRY: Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
JERRY: Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
JERRY: Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess I slipped up.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess so.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess you could.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
JERRY: Yeah, I heard.
JERRY: Yeah, I know about the three dates.
JERRY: Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
JERRY: Yeah, I know how you feel.
JERRY: Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
JERRY: Yeah, I know that!
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
JERRY: Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
JERRY: Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
JERRY: Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
JERRY: Yeah, I liked him.
JERRY: Yeah, I looked. I saw.
JERRY: Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
JERRY: Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
JERRY: Yeah, I really needed that suit.
JERRY: Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
JERRY: Yeah, I saw him.
JERRY: Yeah, I saw the spot.
JERRY: Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
JERRY: Yeah, I started out real classy...
JERRY: Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
JERRY: Yeah, I think I do.
JERRY: Yeah, I think I do.
JERRY: Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
JERRY: Yeah, I think it is. Wheres Elaine?
JERRY: Yeah, I think you would.
JERRY: Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
JERRY: Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
JERRY: Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...
JERRY: Yeah, I was doing new material.
JERRY: Yeah, I washed it.
JERRY: Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
JERRY: Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
JERRY: Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
JERRY: Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
JERRY: Yeah, I'll see ya'.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm free, why?
JERRY: Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal Wild, Wild, Stuff...
JERRY: Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm soured.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure...
JERRY: Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
JERRY: Yeah, I-I know...
JERRY: Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
JERRY: Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
JERRY: Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
JERRY: Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
JERRY: Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
JERRY: Yeah, isn't that something?
JERRY: Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
JERRY: Yeah, it is.
JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
JERRY: Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
JERRY: Yeah, it was a gamble.
JERRY: Yeah, it was alright.
JERRY: Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
JERRY: Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
JERRY: yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
JERRY: Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
JERRY: Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
JERRY: Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
JERRY: Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
JERRY: Yeah, it's funny!
JERRY: Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
JERRY: Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today.
JERRY: Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
JERRY: Yeah, it's no big deal.
JERRY: Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
JERRY: Yeah, it's pretty good.
JERRY: Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
JERRY: Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
JERRY: Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
JERRY: Yeah, its some place down in the village.
JERRY: Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
JERRY: Yeah, Ill see you.
JERRY: Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
JERRY: Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
JERRY: Yeah, Ive heard that about wedding bands.
JERRY: Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
JERRY: Yeah, Koko.
JERRY: Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
JERRY: Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
JERRY: Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
JERRY: Yeah, let's just get out of here.
JERRY: Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
JERRY: Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe we have.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe you won't.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe.
JERRY: Yeah, me either.
JERRY: Yeah, me neither.
JERRY: Yeah, me too.
JERRY: Yeah, me too.
JERRY: Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
JERRY: Yeah, me too...
JERRY: Yeah, my grandma's missing.
JERRY: Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
JERRY: Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
JERRY: Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
JERRY: Yeah, okay. They may have found the car.
JERRY: Yeah, one sec.
JERRY: Yeah, only for a while.
JERRY: Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
JERRY: Yeah, over here.
JERRY: Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
JERRY: Yeah, pretty damn good one, too!
JERRY: Yeah, Queens.
JERRY: Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
JERRY: Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
JERRY: Yeah, see ya.
JERRY: Yeah, see ya.
JERRY: Yeah, see you there.
JERRY: Yeah, see you.
JERRY: Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
JERRY: Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
JERRY: Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
JERRY: Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
JERRY: Yeah, she's coming to see my act tonight.
JERRY: Yeah, she's got a big nose.
JERRY: Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
JERRY: Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh...
JERRY: Yeah, so am I being funny now?
JERRY: Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
JERRY: Yeah, so do you.
JERRY: Yeah, so how's my money?
JERRY: Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
JERRY: Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
JERRY: Yeah, so she and Triangle Boy can go out to fancy restaurants.
JERRY: Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
JERRY: Yeah, so.
JERRY: Yeah, so?
JERRY: Yeah, so?
JERRY: Yeah, so?
JERRY: yeah, so?
JERRY: Yeah, sounds like fun.
JERRY: Yeah, sure we will.
JERRY: Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
JERRY: Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
JERRY: Yeah, take it easy.
JERRY: Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
JERRY: Yeah, thanks.
JERRY: Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
JERRY: Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
JERRY: Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
JERRY: Yeah, that was bad.
JERRY: Yeah, that was me.
JERRY: Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
JERRY: Yeah, that'd be something.
JERRY: Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
JERRY: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
JERRY: Yeah, that's a good tip!
JERRY: Yeah, that's a point...
JERRY: Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
JERRY: Yeah, that's him.
JERRY: Yeah, that's part of it. Kasha?
JERRY: Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right!
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: Yeah, that's true.
JERRY: Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
JERRY: Yeah, that's true...
JERRY: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
JERRY: Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
JERRY: Yeah, that's why I said hi.
JERRY: Yeah, that's your thing.
JERRY: Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
JERRY: Yeah, thats normal. Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
JERRY: Yeah, the guy with the flat head.
JERRY: Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
JERRY: Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
JERRY: Yeah, the other guy.
JERRY: Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
JERRY: Yeah, there's a new one in there.
JERRY: Yeah, there's some sickos out there.
JERRY: Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
JERRY: Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
JERRY: Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
JERRY: Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
JERRY: Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
JERRY: Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
JERRY: Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.
JERRY: Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
JERRY: Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.
JERRY: Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
JERRY: Yeah, tomorrow.
JERRY: Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
JERRY: Yeah, too bad.
JERRY: Yeah, too bad.
JERRY: Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
JERRY: Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.
JERRY: Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.
JERRY: Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
JERRY: Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. Im just, Im really glad youre here.
JERRY: Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
JERRY: Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there.
JERRY: Yeah, we should.
JERRY: Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
JERRY: Yeah, we'll do it another time.
JERRY: Yeah, we'll see ya.
JERRY: Yeah, we'll see.
JERRY: Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
JERRY: Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
JERRY: Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.
JERRY: Yeah, well you're going.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?
JERRY: Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
JERRY: Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
JERRY: Yeah, well, it won't be long.
JERRY: Yeah, well, it's honest.
JERRY: Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
JERRY: Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
JERRY: Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
JERRY: Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
JERRY: Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together.
JERRY: Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
JERRY: Yeah, what else?
JERRY: Yeah, what happened?
JERRY: Yeah, whats it like?
JERRY: Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
JERRY: Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
JERRY: Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
JERRY: Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
JERRY: Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.
JERRY: Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah
JERRY: Yeah, yeah .
JERRY: Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, alright.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. What do you mean you can't tell me?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, lucky me.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, take care of it. Come on, George, what is it?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.
JERRY: yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Dont worry about it.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late.
JERRY: Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. I don't care about that.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah...
JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
JERRY: Yeah, yes.
JERRY: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
JERRY: Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
JERRY: Yeah, you in?
JERRY: Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
JERRY: Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
JERRY: Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
JERRY: Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
JERRY: Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
JERRY: Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
JERRY: Yeah, you told me.
JERRY: Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
JERRY: Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
JERRY: Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
JERRY: Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
JERRY: Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
JERRY: Yeah, you're right.
JERRY: Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
JERRY: Yeah, you, me and George.
JERRY: Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. When are you getting out of there?
JERRY: Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
JERRY: Yeah,, me too.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
JERRY: Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
JERRY: Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! What are you doing with that?
JERRY: Yeah. And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
JERRY: Yeah. And she picked the day!
JERRY: Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
JERRY: Yeah. are you full?
JERRY: Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.
JERRY: Yeah. Come on up.
JERRY: Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
JERRY: Yeah. Eighteen strangles.
JERRY: Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
JERRY: Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.
JERRY: Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
JERRY: Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
JERRY: Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
JERRY: Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
JERRY: Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
JERRY: Yeah. Howd ya do that?
JERRY: Yeah. I don't think this is the jacket.
JERRY: Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
JERRY: Yeah. I hope so ?!
JERRY: Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here, and the part obsessed with sex. Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence.
JERRY: Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
JERRY: Yeah. I really like her.
JERRY: yeah. I think I do.
JERRY: Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
JERRY: Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
JERRY: Yeah. I want that coat.
JERRY: Yeah. I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
JERRY: Yeah. I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
JERRY: Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
JERRY: Yeah. I'm holding the baby.
JERRY: Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
JERRY: Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
JERRY: Yeah. It's in your closet.
JERRY: Yeah. Im having a wonderful time.
JERRY: Yeah. Kramer made it.
JERRY: Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
JERRY: Yeah. Let's go.
JERRY: Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
JERRY: Yeah. Like a farm boy.
JERRY: Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says Hello when he leaves, Good bye when he arrives.
JERRY: Yeah. Look at the time.
JERRY: Yeah. Me.
JERRY: Yeah. Nine oclock.
JERRY: Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy.
JERRY: Yeah. Okay then.
JERRY: Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
JERRY: Yeah. Proctologist.
JERRY: Yeah. Really. Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
JERRY: Yeah. She would love cashmere.
JERRY: Yeah. So you really like this guy.
JERRY: Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
JERRY: Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense
JERRY: Yeah. Specifically 9:30 shows. Seen any good 9:30 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
JERRY: Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone.
JERRY: Yeah. That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. I'm gonna do it.
JERRY: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
JERRY: Yeah. That's true.
JERRY: Yeah. There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
JERRY: Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
JERRY: Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
JERRY: Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
JERRY: Yeah. Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there.
JERRY: Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
JERRY: Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
JERRY: Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fucking good.
JERRY: Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
JERRY: Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
JERRY: Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
JERRY: Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
JERRY: Yeah. What does that mean?
JERRY: Yeah. What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot.
JERRY: Yeah. What's wrong, why?
JERRY: Yeah. Where's George?
JERRY: Yeah. Why?
JERRY: Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
JERRY: Yeah. Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
JERRY: Yeah. Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah. Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.

JERRY: Yeah.. yeah.
JERRY: Yeah...

JERRY: Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
JERRY: Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
JERRY: Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
JERRY: Yes!!!
JERRY: Yes!!!
JERRY: Yes, a man gave you...?
JERRY: Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
JERRY: Yes, A...?
JERRY: Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
JERRY: Yes, all right, Katie.
JERRY: Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
JERRY: Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George: Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again.
JERRY: Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
JERRY: Yes, but--
JERRY: Yes, bye.
JERRY: Yes, change. By all means, change.
JERRY: Yes, clothes. This is normal.
JERRY: Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
JERRY: Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
JERRY: Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
JERRY: Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
JERRY: Yes, he is.
JERRY: Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
JERRY: Yes, I do.
JERRY: Yes, I do.
JERRY: Yes, I do.
JERRY: Yes, I got her number.
JERRY: Yes, I heard you.
JERRY: Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.
JERRY: Yes, I know, I know.
JERRY: Yes, I know. I've flown before.
JERRY: Yes, I pick it up.
JERRY: Yes, I poo-poo.
JERRY: Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
JERRY: Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star.
JERRY: Yes, I will.
JERRY: Yes, I would take her out.
JERRY: Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
JERRY: Yes, I'm fine.
JERRY: Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
JERRY: Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
JERRY: Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
JERRY: Yes, it can.
JERRY: Yes, it is!
JERRY: Yes, it is.
JERRY: Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
JERRY: Yes, it was.
JERRY: Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
JERRY: Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.
JERRY: Yes, its my lifes work.
JERRY: Yes, Ill be stopping.
JERRY: Yes, Im lactose intolerant.

JERRY: Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.
JERRY: Yes, Mr. Beviacqua

JERRY: Yes, that is a definite possibility.
JERRY: Yes, that's right.
JERRY: Yes, the hole!
JERRY: Yes, they do!
JERRY: Yes, they do!
JERRY: Yes, we do.
JERRY: Yes, we have.
JERRY: Yes, well that was nothing.
JERRY: Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
JERRY: Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
JERRY: Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
JERRY: Yes, yes, he is.
JERRY: Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, Why knock my brains out?
JERRY: Yes, yes, I heard.
JERRY: Yes, yes, you have.
JERRY: Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
JERRY: Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Yes.

JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Yes. A bubble boy.
JERRY: Yes. And the mentor advises the protégé.
JERRY: Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
JERRY: Yes. Hes a doctor. Wait a second. What are you doing?
JERRY: Yes. Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. I'll be off in a minute! Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! Are you thinking of ideas? Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. So we're on for later?
JERRY: Yes. I do love her. You have a very nice place here.
JERRY: Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
JERRY: Yes. Melrose Place.
JERRY: Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
JERRY: Yes. Right above me.
JERRY: Yes. That's what was so vexing.
JERRY: Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
JERRY: Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
JERRY: Yes. We did.
JERRY: Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
JERRY: Yes. Yes I am! What else did she say on the phone?
JERRY: Yes. Yes I am. Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
JERRY: Yes. Yes of course.
JERRY: Yes. You're sure there's nothing we can do?
JERRY: Yes?
JERRY: Yes?
JERRY: Yes?
JERRY: Yes?
JERRY: Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
JERRY: Yesterday. Six-ish.
JERRY: Yikes!
JERRY: Yikes.
JERRY: Yikes. Well, good look with all that.
JERRY: Yo?
JERRY: You all right?
JERRY: You also shouldn't use a donut.
JERRY: You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
JERRY: You always take the shirt off?
JERRY: You and George got together?
JERRY: You and me.
JERRY: You and me.
JERRY: You and your toilets.
JERRY: You are not dumb. Don't say that..
JERRY: You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
JERRY: You are soo good lookin'.
JERRY: You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
JERRY: You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
JERRY: You are.
JERRY: You are. I can't get that thing in my car.
JERRY: You asked a date to go to the operation?
JERRY: You asked her out?
JERRY: You asked her to move in with you?
JERRY: You ate more bread?
JERRY: You barbecuing tonight?
JERRY: You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
JERRY: You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
JERRY: You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
JERRY: You better finish your little café latte there. They won't let you in with it.
JERRY: You better hurry.
JERRY: You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
JERRY: You bought it for six!
JERRY: You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
JERRY: You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
JERRY: You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
JERRY: You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
JERRY: You can barely see her face.
JERRY: You can be bleak in spring.
JERRY: You can do that.
JERRY: You can do that.
JERRY: You can eat it?
JERRY: You can go with Kramer
JERRY: You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
JERRY: You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
JERRY: You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
JERRY: You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
JERRY: You can tell me, I'll vault it.
JERRY: You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
JERRY: You can't come up with your own stuff, so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
JERRY: You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
JERRY: You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
JERRY: You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
JERRY: You can't even play.
JERRY: You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
JERRY: You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you...
JERRY: You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
JERRY: You can't go to China What about your job?
JERRY: You can't go wrong with pouty.
JERRY: You can't go?
JERRY: You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
JERRY: You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''. TV.
JERRY: You can't just have water.
JERRY: You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street.
JERRY: You can't make it?
JERRY: You can't play Kramer.
JERRY: You can't prove anything.
JERRY: You can't put a paper towel on his head.
JERRY: You can't take that chemist out.
JERRY: You can't unclog it?
JERRY: You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
JERRY: You cannot buy half a can of soda.
JERRY: You cant believe what I just did.
JERRY: You cant do that.
JERRY: You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
JERRY: You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
JERRY: You cant look in there, were playing!
JERRY: You certainly are. What's going on?
JERRY: You chuck.
JERRY: You collect TV Guide?
JERRY: You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
JERRY: You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go: 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
JERRY: You could be Colin.
JERRY: You could do that?
JERRY: You could get arrested.
JERRY: You could not like it.
JERRY: You could take it? You want it?
JERRY: You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
JERRY: You cried?
JERRY: You crying from Home Alone??
JERRY: You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
JERRY: You did it? What happened?
JERRY: You did not tell me not to sell.
JERRY: You did, you did.
JERRY: You did?
JERRY: You did?
JERRY: You did?!
JERRY: You didn't ...
JERRY: You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
JERRY: You didn't get my papers?
JERRY: You didn't give that thing back?
JERRY: You didn't go?
JERRY: You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
JERRY: You didn't have to push me.
JERRY: You didn't like that crack about the pen.
JERRY: You didn't look down?
JERRY: You didn't mind?
JERRY: You didnt call no interference!
JERRY: You didnt see him. It was horrible.
JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?
JERRY: You do the tub?
JERRY: You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
JERRY: You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
JERRY: You don't drink.
JERRY: You don't even know what a write off is.
JERRY: You don't even know what paba is.
JERRY: You don't flamenco on the first date.
JERRY: You don't have a car.
JERRY: You don't have a Mercedes.
JERRY: You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
JERRY: You don't have to, really.
JERRY: You don't know the half of it.
JERRY: You don't know?
JERRY: You don't know?
JERRY: You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
JERRY: You don't like her?
JERRY: You don't like the Drake?
JERRY: You don't look well.
JERRY: You don't mean here?
JERRY: You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! They're cloning sheep now.
JERRY: You don't seem too bothered by it.
JERRY: You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
JERRY: You don't think she's attractive?
JERRY: You don't think she's just talking to me?
JERRY: You don't think...?
JERRY: You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
JERRY: You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
JERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
JERRY: You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
JERRY: You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
JERRY: You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9:50, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
JERRY: You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
JERRY: You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
JERRY: You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
JERRY: You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
JERRY: You don't wanna get married?
JERRY: You don't wanna tell me?
JERRY: You don't want any of this?
JERRY: You don't want to go with me?
JERRY: You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
JERRY: You dont care?
JERRY: You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? Its George.
JERRY: You dont know Robert Schumann? The composer?
JERRY: You dont know what it was.
JERRY: You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
JERRY: You dont think that I killed her?
JERRY: You dont think... What? The pony remark?
JERRY: You drew up plans for this?
JERRY: You ever find anything?
JERRY: You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
JERRY: You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
JERRY: You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
JERRY: You faked it?
JERRY: You faked it? Why would you do that?
JERRY: You faked with me?
JERRY: You faked with me?
JERRY: You feel better?
JERRY: You fell on her?
JERRY: You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
JERRY: You found the place.
JERRY: You get in the bubble with him?

JERRY: You got evens.
JERRY: You got four hours! What about the script?

JERRY: You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.

JERRY: You gotta wake him up!

JERRY: You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
JERRY: You have a girlfriend?
JERRY: You have a girlfriend?
JERRY: You have a standard fake?
JERRY: You have an airtight case!
JERRY: You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
JERRY: You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. This is an idiot.
JERRY: You have no idea.
JERRY: You have them sleeping in drawers?!
JERRY: You have to know, you must know.
JERRY: You haven't even seen it.
JERRY: You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
JERRY: You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
JERRY: You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
JERRY: You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!

JERRY: You just bought your own dinner.
JERRY: You just can't leave him out there.
JERRY: You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
JERRY: You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
JERRY: You just met the guy yesterday.

JERRY: You kept makin' all the stops?
JERRY: You killed Fredo!
JERRY: You kissed her?
JERRY: You knocked him out.
JERRY: You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
JERRY: You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
JERRY: You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
JERRY: You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
JERRY: You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, and the tuna swim with it.
JERRY: You know Dad just called me.
JERRY: You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out. I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion. After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
JERRY: You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
JERRY: You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
JERRY: You know how they do that?
JERRY: You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep.
JERRY: You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
JERRY: You know I don't even know why I brought you.
JERRY: You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
JERRY: You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
JERRY: You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
JERRY: You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
JERRY: You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
JERRY: You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
JERRY: You know I think this is really helping.
JERRY: You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you.
JERRY: You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
JERRY: You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
JERRY: you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
JERRY: You know I'm paying for these tickets.
JERRY: You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
JERRY: You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
JERRY: You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
JERRY: You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
JERRY: You know it seems impossible.
JERRY: You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
JERRY: You know its not like changing toothpaste.
JERRY: You know Jeffery?
JERRY: You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
JERRY: You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do, so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
JERRY: You know Newman, the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling, crawling on your skin. Up your legs, up your spine, up your back.....
JERRY: You know that awning outside my building?
JERRY: You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
JERRY: You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
JERRY: You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world: I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable.
JERRY: You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
JERRY: You know their timing couldn't be worse.
JERRY: You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
JERRY: You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
JERRY: You know this...
JERRY: You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
JERRY: You know what it was, bad location.
JERRY: You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
JERRY: You know what room Testikov's in?
JERRY: You know what that makes you?...A baldist.
JERRY: You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
JERRY: You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
JERRY: You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
JERRY: You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
JERRY: You know what's good for that? Relish.
JERRY: You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
JERRY: You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
JERRY: You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
JERRY: You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
JERRY: You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
JERRY: You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
JERRY: You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
JERRY: You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
JERRY: You know what? That was the amazing thing.
JERRY: You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with.
JERRY: You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
JERRY: You know who speaks Korean?
JERRY: You know who that is? That's
JERRY: You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
JERRY: You know why? Because people like to say salsa. Excuse me, do you have salsa? We need more salsa. Where is the salsa? No salsa?
JERRY: You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
JERRY: You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
JERRY: You know you're getting gypped over here.
JERRY: You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! Is there anything else?
JERRY: You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
JERRY: You know youre funcifying the whole building.
JERRY: You know! Like a tennis shirt.
JERRY: You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
JERRY: You know, a TV show.
JERRY: You know, furniture.
JERRY: You know, Gary I had a little chat with George the other day...
JERRY: You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
JERRY: You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
JERRY: You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
JERRY: You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
JERRY: You know, I don't even know my IQ.
JERRY: You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
JERRY: You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
JERRY: You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
JERRY: You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
JERRY: You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
JERRY: You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
JERRY: You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
JERRY: You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.
JERRY: You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
JERRY: You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
JERRY: You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
JERRY: You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
JERRY: You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies. So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
JERRY: You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
JERRY: you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
JERRY: You know, I think he wears a piece.
JERRY: You know, I think I'll just take the check.
JERRY: You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
JERRY: You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
JERRY: You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
JERRY: You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
JERRY: You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
JERRY: You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
JERRY: You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
JERRY: You know, I've never seen you drive.
JERRY: You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
JERRY: You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
JERRY: You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the Astonishing Tales of Costanza.
JERRY: You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
JERRY: You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
JERRY: You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
JERRY: You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
JERRY: You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
JERRY: You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
JERRY: You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
JERRY: You know, if your future was a little more certain..
JERRY: You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
JERRY: You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
JERRY: You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
JERRY: you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
JERRY: You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
JERRY: You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
JERRY: You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
JERRY: You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
JERRY: You know, long dark hair.
JERRY: You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
JERRY: You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
JERRY: You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
JERRY: You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
JERRY: You know, Schumann went mad from that.
JERRY: You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
JERRY: You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
JERRY: You know, she won an academy award?
JERRY: You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
JERRY: You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
JERRY: You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
JERRY: You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
JERRY: You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
JERRY: You know, the Maestro.
JERRY: You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
JERRY: You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
JERRY: You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
JERRY: You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
JERRY: You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
JERRY: You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
JERRY: You know, this is your coat.
JERRY: You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
JERRY: You know, what would be great?
JERRY: You know, what you need is a song you can share.
JERRY: You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
JERRY: You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
JERRY: You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
JERRY: You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
JERRY: You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
JERRY: You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
JERRY: You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
JERRY: You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
JERRY: You know, you're little hair hat there.
JERRY: You know, you're not Chinese...
JERRY: You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
JERRY: You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
JERRY: You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
JERRY: You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
JERRY: You left the door open?!
JERRY: You left the keys in the car?
JERRY: You let him fight?
JERRY: You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
JERRY: You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
JERRY: You like full lips.
JERRY: You like him?
JERRY: You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
JERRY: You like that commercial?
JERRY: You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
JERRY: You liked, Newman?
JERRY: You live on this floor?
JERRY: You loaned her Pitt's racquet?
JERRY: You look like a pirate.
JERRY: You look like a tourist.
JERRY: You look like Brenda Starr.
JERRY: You look like something's on your mind.
JERRY: You look like you could use a...
JERRY: You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
JERRY: You lost the 20.
JERRY: You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
JERRY: You may have a point.
JERRY: You mean *a* career.
JERRY: You mean Florence Nightingale. **
JERRY: You mean golf?
JERRY: You mean he just
JERRY: You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
JERRY: You mean it's... No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
JERRY: You mean like..
JERRY: You mean like...Liza!
JERRY: You mean stakeout the lobby?
JERRY: You mean that wasn't uh.
JERRY: You mean that?
JERRY: You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
JERRY: You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
JERRY: You mean what you were wearing?
JERRY: You mean you just started sniffing?
JERRY: You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
JERRY: You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
JERRY: You mentioned the raisins.
JERRY: You met J. Peterman?
JERRY: You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
JERRY: You might have.
JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
JERRY: You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
JERRY: You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
JERRY: you moved into a hotel?
JERRY: You mugged Stephen Hawking?
JERRY: You must be George's cousin.
JERRY: You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
JERRY: You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
JERRY: You must have quite a time down there.
JERRY: you napkin I'm dripping
JERRY: You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
JERRY: You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
JERRY: You need an exterminator?
JERRY: You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
JERRY: You need to talk?
JERRY: You never know.
JERRY: You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
JERRY: You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
JERRY: You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
JERRY: You play a *Hell* of a piano.
JERRY: You plunked him.
JERRY: You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
JERRY: You promise you'll never come in here again?

JERRY: You ripped off a Ziggy?
JERRY: You said gloves...
JERRY: You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
JERRY: You said that already.
JERRY: You said that?
JERRY: You said this to her after.
JERRY: You said you little phony?
JERRY: You satisfied? So you see?
JERRY: You saw her? What was she wearing?
JERRY: You scared me!
JERRY: You see -- ah, uh ...
JERRY: You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
JERRY: You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
JERRY: You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
JERRY: You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
JERRY: You see, I kept up my end of the pact.
JERRY: You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
JERRY: You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
JERRY: You see?
JERRY: You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
JERRY: You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
JERRY: You see?!
JERRY: You seemed a little mad.
JERRY: You should always carry a pad and pen.
JERRY: You should have her work on it for you.
JERRY: You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
JERRY: You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
JERRY: You should try this.
JERRY: You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
JERRY: You should've had some eggs.
JERRY: You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
JERRY: You shut up.
JERRY: You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
JERRY: You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
JERRY: You spent the night at James's? Did we?
JERRY: You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
JERRY: You still using that old alarm clock?
JERRY: You stink worse than I do!
JERRY: You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
JERRY: You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
JERRY: You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
JERRY: You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
JERRY: You sure we're makin' the right move?
JERRY: You sure you don't want the tickets?
JERRY: You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
JERRY: You sure?
JERRY: You sure?
JERRY: You sure?
JERRY: You sure? You look a little pale.
JERRY: You swear?
JERRY: You taking Allison?
JERRY: You talked to him?
JERRY: You tell me.
JERRY: You think he's faking?
JERRY: You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
JERRY: You think I'm too cautious?
JERRY: You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
JERRY: You think she's got toes for thumbs?
JERRY: You think so?
JERRY: You think that's funny?

JERRY: You're still trying to gget that free sub?
JERRY: You're still with the pact?
JERRY: You're such...
JERRY: You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
JERRY: You're sure?
JERRY: You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
JERRY: You're telling me.
JERRY: You're telling me.
JERRY: You're the best.
JERRY: You're the man!
JERRY: You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.

JERRY: Youre welcome.
JERRY: Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
JERRY: Yum yum little tuna fishy?
JERRY: Yup.
JERRY: Yup.
JERRY: Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
JERRY: Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
JERRY: Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
JERRY: Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
JERRY: Zephyr? That is not a word.
JERRY: Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
JERRY: Cause you know, I love Elaine.
JERRY: 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
JERRY: Keys?!
JERRY: Lemon Tree.
JERRY: Quone?
JERRY: Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
JERRY: So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
JERRY: Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
JERRY:..what?
JERRY:Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
JERRY:See ya. what's with you?
JERRY:What's that?

JOAN: Are you happy?
JOAN: Hi Jerry. Mmmwah.
JOAN: How you doing?
JOAN: Just pretty good? Not great?
JOAN: Okay. Have a nice day.
JOANNE: Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop.
JOANNE: I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.
JOANNE: Joel what?
JOANNE: She doesnt even need to knock!
JOANNE: So where's he taking you?
JOANNE: So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it.
JOANNE: Well, Jerry, itll be nice having a close friend nearby.
JOANNE: Yea, poor kid. What an ordeal.
JOANNE: Yeah. What's his name?
JOANNE: You are one lucky girl. Wish I could find a nice guy. Hi Aaron.
JODI: A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.
JODI: Actually, I should get a new one.
JODI: Can we go?
JODI: Did you see the way that he was eating?
JODI: Hey, Jerry.
JODI: Hey.
JODI: Hi. I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.
JODI: How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?
JODI: I can't
JODI: I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.
JODI: I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.
JODI: I have to tell you, I really don't like him.
JODI: I was giving Kramer a massage.
JODI: I'm getting out of here. Don't call me.
JODI: I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.
JODI: It's just I hate that type.
JODI: Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. I'm getting out of here.
JODI: Nice meeting you Karen.
JODI: No means no.
JODI: No that's O.K.
JODI: No, I can't!
JODI: No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.
JODI: Now you however, you, I like.
JODI: Oh yeah.
JODI: Really, how?
JODI: So what did she say?
JODI: So what's the deal with your friend George?
JODI: So, where do you wanna go?
JODI: They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.
JODI: We have nothing to talk about.
JODI: What are you doing?
JODI: What do you think I'm doing?
JODI: What was all that attractive women not getting tickets nonsense?
JODI: What's with this music?
JODI: Yeah.
JODI: Yeah. I heard you.
JODI: You just said that you said it.
JODI: You've never met.
JOE DEVOLA: Good luck on the pilot Jerry.
JOE DEVOLA: SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!

JOE DIVOLA: Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there.

You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
JOE DIVOLA: Pagliacci kills his wife.

JOE DIVOLA: What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?
JOE DIVOLA: Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?
JOE DIVOLA: Why
JOE DIVOLA: You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?
JOE DIVOLA: You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.
JOE DIVOLA: You people make me sick.
JOE DIVOLA: You're not leaving
JOE DIVOLA: You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.

JOE: How's it going?
JOE: I stand behind my fruit.
JOE: I'll pause it, okay?
JOE: I'll tell you something else: I don't what your business anymore either.
JOE: No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!
JOE: Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us?
JOE: Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?
JOE: So what do you want me to do?
JOE: That's exactly what I'm saying.
JOE: The lights are fine.
JOE: This fruit isn't for you.
JOE: This is George Costanza.
JOE: Well let me put a solution for ya: do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.
JOE: Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.
JOE: What did you want?
JOE: What's the difference?
JOE: When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.
JOE: Why didn't you just read the book?
JOE: Yeah.
JOE: You think I don't know huh? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!
JOE: You're banned.
JOEL: ...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.
JOEL: After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.

JOEL: Hey.
JOEL: How can you say that?
JOEL: I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to GO SEE HIS SHOW! I mean, Im your biggest fan!
JOEL: I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it.
JOEL: I have to eat! I mean, Im hypoglycemic.
JOEL: I mean, youre my best friend.
JOEL: Is there a real bird in the back?
JOEL: Kramer.
JOEL: Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. I hate it.
JOEL: Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know youre a very busy guy.
JOEL: M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?
JOEL: Massaging your neck.
JOEL: Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!
JOEL: Ned?
JOEL: NEXT!
JOEL: NO, NO. COME ON!
JOEL: No, there's no resemblance.
JOEL: Not working? What are you talking about?
JOEL: O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.
JOEL: O.K.
JOEL: O.K. you got your list?
JOEL: Oh, the game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.
JOEL: Oh, youve been under a lot of stress.
JOEL: Okay. Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, thatd be great. So, next Wednesday.
JOEL: Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?
JOEL: Right.
JOEL: So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?
JOEL: So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? And why dont you come along?
JOEL: Stu--Stuart's no good?
JOEL: Stuart.
JOEL: Sure?
JOEL: That's my mother.
JOEL: Tonight?
JOEL: Uh, boning up on football?
JOEL: Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.
JOEL: Wait, youll never guess who I ran into.
JOEL: Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out, okay? Unbelievable.
JOEL: Well, lets just take a look here.
JOEL: What about Thursday night? I mean theyre playing the Sonics.
JOEL: What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?
JOEL: What?
JOEL: Where is that waitress? Hey!
JOEL: Who would be calling me here?
JOEL: Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?
JOEL: Yeah.
JOEL: Yeah. Why? Is that weird?
JOEL: You know, I should really try something like that.
JOEL: Youre one of the few people I can talk to.
JOEY: A Monster
JOEY: Aah! It's Frankinstein! Frankinstein!
JOEY: AH!!
JOEY: Come on, Kramer!
JOEY: Come on. Mom's down in the car.
JOEY: Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris.
JOEY: Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?
JOEY: She had a little change of plans.
JOEY: Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?
JOEY: Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..
JOHN TYLER: How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken.
JOHN TYLER: Let if ferment, just like everything else.
JOHN TYLER: Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily.
JOHN: Absolutely.
JOHN: And you know what?
JOHN: Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed.
JOHN: I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding a new number to my, you know, repertoire.
JOHN: Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before the next show. My place is only a few blocks from here.
JOHN: Nevertheless...
JOHN: Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called  Hot And Heavy.
JOHN: This show looks interesting. Isn't he that Seinfeld fellow you went out with?
JOHN: What're you talking about?
JOHN: Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed.
JOHN: Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your apartment and do a safety check.
JOHN: Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that.
JOHNNY: Hey Mick.
JOHNNY: I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. I'll find out.
JOHNNY: Nah, that's not it. Something else... Ya you look different.
JOHNNY: Somethin different about you.
JOHNNY: What gives...what's going on? Goin' out with Tammy?
JOY MAYO: Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?
JOY MAYO: And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system?
JOY MAYO: Elaine, thanks for coming.
JOY MAYO: Elaine...
JOY MAYO: Hey, I got a coat just like this!
JOY MAYO: Hey, Jerry.
JOY MAYO: I need you to be in charge of coats.
JOY MAYO: Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!
JOY MAYO: Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?
JOY MAYO: Thanks. Jerry...
JOYCE: Are you psyched?
JOYCE: Did you get your hair done today?
JOYCE: He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello.
JOYCE: He asked about you.
JOYCE: He said you were just his type.
JOYCE: He wanted to know your situation.
JOYCE: He's gonna be in your class today.
JOYCE: Hi!
JOYCE: I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.
JOYCE: I-I told him you were single.
JOYCE: Let me just put this back.
JOYCE: See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?
JOYCE: So, when was the last time you took a class?
JOYCE: Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here.
JOYCE: You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.
JUDGE: ...and sold at auction.
JUDGE: ...convenient to your home.
JUDGE: Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded...
JUDGE: And then what happened?
JUDGE: I don't understand.
JUDGE: I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---
JUDGE: Mister Newman.
JUDGE: So then he didn't kill himself.
JUDGE: That'll be seventy-five dollars.
JUDGE: That's enough already.
JUDGE: This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.
JUDGE: Uh, continue.
JUDGE: Uh, could you get to the speeding?
JUDGE: Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly for yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage...
JUDGE: You may step down.
JUDY: Hello.
JUDY: Hey! What about lunch?
JUDY: Hey!!!!.
JUDY: Hi, Elaine. How are you?
JUDY: It is my pleasure, just make sure you give that manuscript a good read.
JUDY: Oh, hi.
JUDY: Read it twice if you have to. This is a big step in your career.
JUDY: Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it.
JUDY: Yeah. I'm sure they Fedexed you a manuscript. They want to see that you can read an unpublished work and give insightful criticism.
JUDY: You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!
JULIANNA: ...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want.
JULIANNA: Excuse me?
JULIANNA: I don't know.
JULIANNA: I don't live near here, ya know!
JULIANNA: I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!
JULIANNA: No.
JULIANNA: Oh.
JULIANNA: Please!
JULIANNA: She had references.
JULIANNA: We have a woman. Why?
JULIANNA: Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.
JULIE: Although at times can be rather pedantic.
JULIE: And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.
JULIE: George, all I did was hand someone a bag.
JULIE: Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.
JULIE: Here's your big salad.
JULIE: Hi Jerry.
JULIE: Hi.
JULIE: I like Anna Quindlen's column and Safire. Don't you like Safire?
JULIE: I like your shirt too.
JULIE: I'm crazy about Merlot.
JULIE: No, no. I'd like to take you out.
JULIE: Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this.
JULIE: Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name.
JULIE: Oh, thank you.
JULIE: Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?
JULIE: Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.
JULIE: Okay, thanks, George.
JULIE: Please come, Elaine.
JULIE: Sorry e're late.
JULIE: Sure, George.
JULIE: That's what I'm suggesting.
JULIE: Um, did she?
JULIE: Well I like it, too.
JULIE: Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?
JULIE: Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.
JULIE: Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.
JULIO: Awright.
JULIO: Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry.
JULIO: Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to people, huh?
JULIO: Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld, maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each other.
KAREN: Ah ah ah ah
KAREN: All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
KAREN: Anyhow, what is the difference?
KAREN: As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
KAREN: Because I said so.
KAREN: But I've never sung before in my life!
KAREN: Generally.
KAREN: George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
KAREN: George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know...
KAREN: Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
KAREN: Hi, Kramer.
KAREN: I am in your hands. Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. Kenneth will take you home.
KAREN: I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
KAREN: I didn't pick up anything.
KAREN: I didn't see a face.
KAREN: I like your shirt.
KAREN: I love Merlot.
KAREN: I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
KAREN: I really wanted you.
KAREN: I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
KAREN: I'd like you to leave.
KAREN: I'm a little nervous!
KAREN: I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.
KAREN: I'm very satisfied.
KAREN: It must have been an accident.
KAREN: Jerry?
KAREN: Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
KAREN: Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
KAREN: Magic.
KAREN: Maybe.
KAREN: Mmm What's not necessary?
KAREN: Mmmm, Oh George, oooh.
KAREN: Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm Mmmm Woo
KAREN: Mom, Dad.
KAREN: My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
KAREN: No good?
KAREN: No, no...it's O.K. Go on.
KAREN: O.K., this is it!
KAREN: Of course.
KAREN: Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
KAREN: Oh, so do I.
KAREN: Really enjoyed it.
KAREN: Really.
KAREN: She's very nice. Let's discuss this later.
KAREN: Six.
KAREN: So soon?
KAREN: That is so funny.
KAREN: That makes sense.
KAREN: They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!
KAREN: Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?
KAREN: Well hurry up.
KAREN: Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.
KAREN: Well, I'm wearing this red dress -
KAREN: Well, it's not like after the Risotto.
KAREN: Well, now I hate you!
KAREN: Well, what could she have done?
KAREN: What are you talking about?
KAREN: What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
KAREN: What else?
KAREN: What, do you think I've never had a massage before?
KAREN: What, what?
KAREN: What, you got a little thing for her?
KAREN: Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
KAREN: Why?
KAREN: Yeah
KAREN: Yeah.
KAREN: Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
KAREN: Yes, I see. O.K.
KAREN: You really know a lot about this, don't you?
KAREN: You think I was faking?
KAREN: You were extremely personable.
KAREN: You're going now?
KARL: I 'm gonna have to seal the place up for 48 hours and fog it. That's the only way to get rid of them.
KARL: I don't explain 'em Mr. Seinfeld. I just exterminate them.
KARL: Well, unless you want to kill them. They can't stay in here. This stuff is pretty toxic. I'll go get my stuff, it's in the truck.
KARL: Yep!...In your bedroom too Mr. Seinfeld. You've got a full outbreak of fleas on your hands.
KATE: Because even if you have to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.
KATE: By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience.
KATE: Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this.
KATE: I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.
KATE: I knew it.
KATE: I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?]
KATE: I'm not sure.
KATE: I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.
KATE: It didn't go very well, did it?
KATE: It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week.
KATE: Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
KATE: Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-
KATE: Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?
KATE: Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?
KATE: Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.
KATE: Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference?
KATE: Okay, you're a big celebrity.
KATE: Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show.
KATE: The eight will get you in a little earlier.
KATE: There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want?
KATE: Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out.
KATE: Yeah, it's eight in the morning.
KATE: You told me not to bother you with minor details.
KATHY LEE: But he's adorable.
KATHY LEE: Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I-I love coffee tables, and I-I thought I was the only one.
KATHY LEE: I did.
KATHY LEE: I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!
KATHY LEE: I love his hair.
KATHY LEE: I love this.
KATHY LEE: I want one of these.
KATHY LEE: Is that fabulous?
KATHY LEE: Is that fabulous?
KATHY LEE: It's all over my dress.
KATHY LEE: Please, please.
KATHY LEE: This coffee table is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.
KATHY LEE: Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!
KATIE: And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James.
KATIE: George, George, you're on.
KATIE: I heard what happened to the junior high. They can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional.
KATIE: Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it.
KATIE: Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone.
KATIE: Jerry.
KATIE: Jerry.
KATIE: Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry.
KATIE: Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly.
KATIE: Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you.
KATIE: Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. Katie works for Jerry.
KATIE: One of you has to go on.
KATIE: Sorry for the late notice.
KATIE: They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls.
KATIE: Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--
KATIE: Yes.
KATIE: You're the--
KATY: Also ear, nose and throat.
KATY: He's funny.
KATY: Hitler? Maybe.
KATY: I actually would've set you up with a friend of mine.
KATY: Loves bald.
KATY: Marisa Tomei.
KATY: Oh, you did? Oh.
KATY: Pippi Longstocking? Hmm, I don't don't know.
KATY: That's right.
KATY: Yeah, I know.
KATY: Yeah, she's just been sitting home.
KATY: Yeah.
KATY: You'd be perfect for her. She loves quirky, funny guys.
KATYA: Ah, Misha!
KATYA: And you could not refuse.
KATYA: He was a very bad dictator.
KATYA: He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.
KATYA: I can balance myself in any position.
KATYA: In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the Comedian. You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian.
KATYA: It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.
KATYA: It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.
KATYA: It is horrible!
KATYA: Misha, this is Jerry.
KATYA: My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.
KATYA: Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.
KATYA: So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?
KATYA: Yes. We are here.
KEITH: Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.
KEITH: Can I help you?
KEITH: Come on I won the MVP in 79. I can do whatever I want to.
KEITH: Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?
KEITH: Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.
KEITH: Goodnight. Oh, Jer, by the way, the woman we gave a ride to earlier tonight,
KEITH: Hello.
KEITH: Hey, I didn't spit at you.
KEITH: I don't have to but I will.
KEITH: I gotta move.
KEITH: I love that bit about Jimmy Olson
KEITH: I'd love some.
KEITH: I'm Keith Hernandez.
KEITH: I've always wanted to do what you do.
KEITH: Leave ...
KEITH: look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.
KEITH: Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But...
KEITH: Maybe they should get together. Go ahead. Kiss her. I'm a baseball player dammit.
KEITH: Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.
KEITH: No should I
KEITH: Not with ...
KEITH: Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.
KEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee
KEITH: Really, you know my mom's one quarter Cajun.
KEITH: Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.
KEITH: UH, do you want to catch a movie this weekend? Have you seen JFK?
KEITH: Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
KEITH: Well, goodnight
KEITH: Well, how about this Friday?
KEITH: Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..
KEITH: Well, there was two outs, bottom of the tenth, we're one out away from losing the series.
KEITH: What's that?
KEITH: Who's this chucker?
KEITH: Would you mind if I gave her a call?
KEITH: Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.
KEITH: Yeah, it really was.
KEITH: Yeah, it was. Gosh, should I kiss her good night?
KEITH: Yeah.
KEITH: Yeah. What's her story?
KEITH: You know, I live on the East Side.
KEITH: YOU said, Nice game, pretty boy.
KEITH: You sure you don't mind?
KELLY: Can I take your order?
KELLY: Egg white omelet and Big Salad.
KELLY: Hello
KELLY: I just wanted you guys know that Friday's my last day. Bloomingdales ordered a bunch of my clips, thank God, I don't have to do this any more.
KELLY: Oh he's not my boyfriend. It's that bald guy with the glasses, who's always here with them. He's trying to get me in trouble.
KELLY: Ooh look out. You stepped right in it.
KELLY: So then about a year ago I started selling, these funky little hair clips. It's going pretty good. I make them in my apartment.
KELLY: That's a nice watch George.
KELLY: Well, what's it going to be?
KELLY: Yeah, he loves watches. He's a real watch freak.
KELLY: Yes. What'll you have? Are you eating? It's in that vein.
KELLY: You know, my boyfriend has the same one.
KEN: ...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here.
KEN: Are you okay, honey?
KEN: Doctor says it could be any day now.
KEN: George! She's in labour!
KEN: George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!
KEN: How about Joan?
KEN: Just keep breathing, okay.
KEN: Now's not the best time, George!
KEN: Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the hospital...
KEN: Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.
KEN: Okay.
KEN: Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. It's very unusual.
KEN: Well, we don't care for Soda.
KEN: What is it?
KEN: What?
KEN: Why can't we use Seven?
KEN: Yeah, but uh... Soda?
KEN: You don't like Kimberley?
KERI: And a tin of altoids.
KERI: And can you help to carry my keys?
KERI: Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?
KERI: Do you still have my lipstick?
KERI: Guess not.
KERI: My job was to keep you away from the music.
KERI: Nice carryall.
KERI: Nice.
KERI: Ready to go?
KERI: You don't go that often?
KERNIS: I hear you, guy.
KERNIS: Sorry.
KERNIS: Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?
KESSLER: Are you up?
KESSLER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?
KESSLER: Hey, he really likes you, George.
KESSLER: Hey, Im sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew. You got any meat?
KESSLER: Hows the real estate-business?
KESSLER: I thought I wasnt allowed to be in here this weekend.
KESSLER: Its unbelievable.
KESSLER: Oh, give me it...let me talk to her.
KESSLER: Oh, hes gettin a drink of water. Is this for that girl?
KESSLER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer.
KESSLER: SLIDE! Wow!
KESSLER: What happened? Well, they STUNK, thats what happened!
KESSLER: When youre done, let me know.
KESSLER: Why even give her an option for?
KESSLER: Why even give her an option?
KESSLER: Yeah. Are you done with this?
KESSLER: You better believe it.
KESSLER: You keep me posted!
KESSLER: You know, I almost wound up going to that game.
KESSLER: You want me to talk to her?
KEVIN: Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
KEVIN: All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
KEVIN: Besides, anyone can do it.
KEVIN: Come on in!
KEVIN: Elaine, you've changed my life.
KEVIN: Fourth row, center.
KEVIN: Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

KEVIN: I got a vasectomy this morning.
KEVIN: I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
KEVIN: Just reading..
KEVIN: Nice. Who is it?
KEVIN: No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
KEVIN: No. You got it last time.
KEVIN: Not at all.
KEVIN: Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
KEVIN: Oh, so what did you do?

KID: Commie, Commie, Commie . . . .
KID: Hey, this guy's a COMMIE!
KID: Hey, you're riding a girl's bike.
KID: I want a racing car set.
KID: Is there anybody else here but you?

KID: No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.
KID: This guy's a Commie. He's spreading propoganda.
KID: Who's Bozo?
KID: You are!
KID: You're ugly.
KID: You're ugly.
KIM: Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us.
KIM: Frank?
KIM: I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.
KIM: No.
KIM: Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off.
KIM: That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight.
KIM: Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this.
KIM: You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever want to see you again.
KIMBROUGH: And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
KIMBROUGH: Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development, and it was pretty much same old, same old.
KIMBROUGH: Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, Jerry, that he developed five years ago.
KIMBROUGH: Can I get you anything?
KIMBROUGH: He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.
KIMBROUGH: Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.
KIMBROUGH: Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?
KIMBROUGH: Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.
KIMBROUGH: That's right.
KIMBROUGH: What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.
KIMBROUGH: Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.
KLEIN: His buttocks are sublime!
KLEIN: Interesting face..
KLEIN: Sit down, eh? You're very lean, but muscular..
KLEIN: You're spectacular.
KLEIN: You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful.

KRAMER: Alright, you got something better?
KRAMER: Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
KRAMER: Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
KRAMER: Alright.
KRAMER: Alright.
KRAMER: Alright.
KRAMER: Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
KRAMER: Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
KRAMER: Alright. I'm ready. You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
KRAMER: Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
KRAMER: Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
KRAMER: alright.. George you got it?
KRAMER: Alright.. How do you like this? Ya!
KRAMER: Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
KRAMER: Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
KRAMER: An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
KRAMER: An In The Park Home Run!
KRAMER: Anatoly! Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
KRAMER: And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
KRAMER: And Buck Showalter's?
KRAMER: And go we will.
KRAMER: And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
KRAMER: And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
KRAMER: And I need something to write on.
KRAMER: And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
KRAMER: And I'm glad I did. Here.
KRAMER: And it could be done.
KRAMER: And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
KRAMER: And laughter is the best medicine.
KRAMER: And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
KRAMER: And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
KRAMER: And she doesn't know anything, about this?
KRAMER: And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! It's killing me Jerry!
KRAMER: And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
KRAMER: And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
KRAMER: And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
KRAMER: And this. Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry, ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here --
KRAMER: And to the bathroom.
KRAMER: And we all know how painful that can be.
KRAMER: And we're off.
KRAMER: And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
KRAMER: And yet, he's my friend.
KRAMER: And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
KRAMER: And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
KRAMER: And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
KRAMER: And you'll get it back.
KRAMER: And you're going to go out with her.
KRAMER: And you're saying she's deaf.
KRAMER: And...cucumbers!
KRAMER: And..voila!
KRAMER: And?
KRAMER: And?
KRAMER: Another Festivus miracle!
KRAMER: Antonio. In here!
KRAMER: Any mustard? This is empty.
KRAMER: Any news?
KRAMER: Any word from Nana?
KRAMER: Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
KRAMER: Anything new with that guy on drugs?
KRAMER: Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes: They're meaningless!
KRAMER: Anything...
KRAMER: Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
KRAMER: Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
KRAMER: Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
KRAMER: Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
KRAMER: Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
KRAMER: Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
KRAMER: Apparently.
KRAMER: Are they war veterans?
KRAMER: Are those shoes comfortable?
KRAMER: Are too.
KRAMER: Are too.
KRAMER: Are too.
KRAMER: are we doing a bad thing?
KRAMER: Are we getting this?
KRAMER: Are you all right?
KRAMER: Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
KRAMER: Are you gonna need this?
KRAMER: Are you guys ready?
KRAMER: Are you kidding me?
KRAMER: Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
KRAMER: Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
KRAMER: Are you still on the pill?
KRAMER: Are you sure you're not pregnant?
KRAMER: Are you sure?
KRAMER: Are you through?
KRAMER: Are you through?
KRAMER: Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry.
KRAMER: Arrest?
KRAMER: As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
KRAMER: As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
KRAMER: As soon as the game is over..
KRAMER: Ashtrays?
KRAMER: Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
KRAMER: Assman.
KRAMER: Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
KRAMER: At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
KRAMER: Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
KRAMER: Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
KRAMER: Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
KRAMER: Aw, beautiful!
KRAMER: Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.
KRAMER: Aw, c'mon.
KRAMER: Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.
KRAMER: Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
KRAMER: Aw, okay. Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. He always hides it from me. Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
KRAMER: Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.
KRAMER: Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
KRAMER: Aw, you really hurting, huh?
KRAMER: Aw.
KRAMER: Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
KRAMER: Awe, alright
KRAMER: Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
KRAMER: Awright, hands up, porky!
KRAMER: Awright, I got it.
KRAMER: Awright, my work is done here.
KRAMER: Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.
KRAMER: Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
KRAMER: b'd b'd
KRAMER: Back and to the left
KRAMER: Bad news, my friend.
KRAMER: Bailing?
KRAMER: Bald?
KRAMER: Bania, you're killing me.
KRAMER: Bania?
KRAMER: Barry?
KRAMER: Be realistic George.
KRAMER: Because *you're* silly. Get it? Yeah...
KRAMER: Because he's scared, Jerry.
KRAMER: Because I don't have a table.
KRAMER: Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter.
KRAMER: Because I wanted to look good for the party.
KRAMER: Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
KRAMER: Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. Oh, is this for the fight?
KRAMER: Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this I'm only showing eight fingers.
KRAMER: Because I'm workin' there, that's why.
KRAMER: Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
KRAMER: Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
KRAMER: Because it doesn't concern you.
KRAMER: Because it's no good.
KRAMER: Because Im a pod?
KRAMER: Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
KRAMER: Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
KRAMER: Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
KRAMER: Because of the coffee thing?
KRAMER: Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
KRAMER: Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
KRAMER: Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
KRAMER: Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
KRAMER: Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
KRAMER: Because we're blind to their tyranny.
KRAMER: Because we're engaged.
KRAMER: Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
KRAMER: Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
KRAMER: Beg me.
KRAMER: Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance!
KRAMER: Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
KRAMER: Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished oink of pig-man cries out for help.
KRAMER: Bennette right?
KRAMER: Best two out of three? One spot, two spot..
KRAMER: Bet? Um, not betting.
KRAMER: Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
KRAMER: Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
KRAMER: Better get that
KRAMER: Big mistake.
KRAMER: Big! Big!
KRAMER: Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
KRAMER: Blood!
KRAMER: Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
KRAMER: Bombs away .
KRAMER: Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
KRAMER: Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
KRAMER: Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
KRAMER: Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home in a body bag.
KRAMER: Boy, I am really surprised at you. You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
KRAMER: Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
KRAMER: Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple.
KRAMER: Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
KRAMER: Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
KRAMER: Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
KRAMER: Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
KRAMER: Boy, you're looking sharp there Tim.
KRAMER: Boy...
KRAMER: Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.
KRAMER: Break up with her
KRAMER: Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
KRAMER: Bro!
KRAMER: Bro.
KRAMER: Brody's in.
KRAMER: Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
KRAMER: Brought my phone.
KRAMER: Brown?
KRAMER: Buddy Hackett?
KRAMER: Buenos dias.
KRAMER: Buenos dias.
KRAMER: Buffer zone
KRAMER: Bugger!
KRAMER: Bulimic,
KRAMER: But first, we're talking with, Jerry. Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
KRAMER: But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
KRAMER: BUT I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING.
KRAMER: But I did sit in mud.
KRAMER: But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
KRAMER: But I want to--
KRAMER: But I'm tired..
KRAMER: But it's Festivus.
KRAMER: But Jackie--
KRAMER: But now I have a big problem, buddy.
KRAMER: But she really looks like a Lily
KRAMER: But that's not Hello.
KRAMER: But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
KRAMER: But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
KRAMER: But this'll get you around?
KRAMER: But wasn't that taken off the market?
KRAMER: But what am I gonna do for fruit?
KRAMER: But where does the meat go?
KRAMER: But why?
KRAMER: But you *will* use... a retractor.
KRAMER: But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
KRAMER: But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
KRAMER: But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
KRAMER: But you haven't seen..
KRAMER: But, it's only a toy!
KRAMER: By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
KRAMER: Bye!!
KRAMER: Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
KRAMER: Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.
KRAMER: C'mon buddy.
KRAMER: C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
KRAMER: C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
KRAMER: C'mon here, try 'em on.
KRAMER: C'mon it's my turn.
KRAMER: C'mon Jerry!
KRAMER: C'mon Seattle, let's go.
KRAMER: C'mon!

KRAMER: C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
KRAMER: C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
KRAMER: C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!
KRAMER: C'mon, let's go.
KRAMER: C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
KRAMER: C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?
KRAMER: C'mon.
KRAMER: Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.
KRAMER: Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.
KRAMER: Call him and tell him
KRAMER: Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for. .
KRAMER: CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
KRAMER: Can do.
KRAMER: Can I get in on that?
KRAMER: Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, That's what I thin k of your party.
KRAMER: Can I sleep with you?
KRAMER: Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
KRAMER: Can you do that for me, buddy?
KRAMER: Can you give him a cookie?
KRAMER: Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
KRAMER: Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
KRAMER: Can't hear a thing.
KRAMER: Can't help ya, kid.
KRAMER: Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
KRAMER: Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
KRAMER: Cash.
KRAMER: Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
KRAMER: Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga
KRAMER: Cat fight?
KRAMER: Cause I know what happened, Jerry. Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
KRAMER: Cause Im getting rid of it.

KRAMER: Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?

KRAMER: Do you have any prospects?
KRAMER: Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.

KRAMER: Doc, huh?
KRAMER: Does George know?
KRAMER: Does that bother you?
KRAMER: Does your girlfriend have to be here?
KRAMER: Don't be a fool.
KRAMER: Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
KRAMER: Don't blame me.
KRAMER: Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. Look at that.
KRAMER: Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
KRAMER: Don't really remember.

KRAMER: Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
KRAMER: Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
KRAMER: Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!
KRAMER: Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
KRAMER: Don't you get tired of following rules?
KRAMER: Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
KRAMER: Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!

KRAMER: Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
KRAMER: Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
KRAMER: Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
KRAMER: Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
KRAMER: Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
KRAMER: Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
KRAMER: Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.

KRAMER: Elaine, you want to stop?
KRAMER: Elaine.
KRAMER: Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?
KRAMER: Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
KRAMER: Elaine?
KRAMER: Elaine?
KRAMER: Elaine?
KRAMER: Eleven, corner pocket.
KRAMER: Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.

KRAMER: Feel this.
KRAMER: Fifteenth, Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
KRAMER: First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. Every muscles she touches just... ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy.
KRAMER: First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.

KRAMER: Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
KRAMER: Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
KRAMER: Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
KRAMER: Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
KRAMER: Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
KRAMER: Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
KRAMER: Freeze, mother!
KRAMER: From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
KRAMER: From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
KRAMER: From pain, will come pleasure.
KRAMER: From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
KRAMER: From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.
KRAMER: From who?
KRAMER: From you?

KRAMER: George is saying Cut it.
KRAMER: George says Cut it.
KRAMER: George!
KRAMER: George! George!
KRAMER: George, do me a solid? Two minutes.
KRAMER: George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
KRAMER: George, I thought that was the door.
KRAMER: George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
KRAMER: George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.

KRAMER: George, we're sorry.
KRAMER: George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

KRAMER: George, you gonna buy a painting?
KRAMER: George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
KRAMER: George, you wanna go for a ride?
KRAMER: George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti

KRAMER: Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
KRAMER: Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
KRAMER: Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed.
KRAMER: Good for you.
KRAMER: Good idea.
KRAMER: Good luck with that.
KRAMER: Good morning, gentlemen.
KRAMER: Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
KRAMER: Good one? It's the Commando 8.

KRAMER: Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
KRAMER: Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
KRAMER: Gu-gu- cada-
KRAMER: Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
KRAMER: H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.
KRAMER: h-Yeah...
KRAMER: Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
KRAMER: Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
KRAMER: Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
KRAMER: Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time.
KRAMER: Hah?
KRAMER: Hahaa!
KRAMER: Haircut.
KRAMER: Hal, .. uh Langerhans.
KRAMER: Hang on.
KRAMER: Happy birthday paruba!
KRAMER: Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
KRAMER: Have a good one.
KRAMER: Have we been intimate?
KRAMER: Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way: It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
KRAMER: Have you ever met my guys?
KRAMER: Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
KRAMER: Have you seen George?
KRAMER: He almost beat me.
KRAMER: he asked me
KRAMER: He begged me.
KRAMER: He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
KRAMER: He can't even walk down the street in South America...

KRAMER: He didn't come with us.
KRAMER: He doesn't like you.
KRAMER: He had breasts.
KRAMER: He he, yeah.
KRAMER: He is just setting the record straight.
KRAMER: He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.
KRAMER: He jumped.
KRAMER: He just sunk like a stone.
KRAMER: He looks happy to me.
KRAMER: He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
KRAMER: He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
KRAMER: He overcooked it. It's ruined.
KRAMER: He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
KRAMER: He says I don't want to sleep alone. She says, oh boy, love to.
KRAMER: He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
KRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, I'm hit!
KRAMER: He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
KRAMER: He thinks you're a phony.
KRAMER: He wants to talk.
KRAMER: He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
KRAMER: He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
KRAMER: He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
KRAMER: He's a genius. Here we go...
KRAMER: He's a happy camper huh?
KRAMER: He's a hell of a guy.
KRAMER: He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. Name tags!
KRAMER: He's gonna make us very happy.
KRAMER: He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
KRAMER: He's gyppin' us...
KRAMER: He's holistic, George. He's holistic.
KRAMER: He's in jail.
KRAMER: He's lying.
KRAMER: He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
KRAMER: He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
KRAMER: He's my caddy.
KRAMER: He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
KRAMER: He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
KRAMER: He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
KRAMER: He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
KRAMER: He's quite a character, isn't he?
KRAMER: He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
KRAMER: He's ripping me off
KRAMER: He's spaced out.
KRAMER: He's the *phone* man!
KRAMER: He's very generous, isn't he?
KRAMER: He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly.
KRAMER: HE..YA. AYA. AYYYYYAAAAA!!!!

KRAMER: I don't know where the tops are.
KRAMER: I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
KRAMER: I don't know!
KRAMER: I don't know! But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
KRAMER: I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. It would be nice if you got him something.
KRAMER: I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
KRAMER: I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
KRAMER: I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know.
KRAMER: I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
KRAMER: I don't know. Uh, no more questions.
KRAMER: I don't know..
KRAMER: I don't know...
KRAMER: I don't like her.
KRAMER: I don't like it.
KRAMER: I don't like it...
KRAMER: I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
KRAMER: I don't see any tissues back her.. Wait a minute!.. This isn't the way to the park! Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! You're taking me to the doctor!
KRAMER: I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
KRAMER: I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
KRAMER: I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
KRAMER: I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
KRAMER: I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out.
KRAMER: I don't wanna exclude anybody.
KRAMER: I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! I want a Papaya King hot dog!
KRAMER: I don't wanna go back on there!
KRAMER: I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. And I thank you.
KRAMER: I don't want the keys!
KRAMER: I don't want this on my conscience.
KRAMER: I don't want to!
KRAMER: I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. Is that clock right?
KRAMER: I dont understand.
KRAMER: I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
KRAMER: I dont want the levels!
KRAMER: I drank too much water in the shower.
KRAMER: I expect you both to be there.
KRAMER: I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...
KRAMER: I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
KRAMER: I find you extremely ugly...
KRAMER: I forgot. Wait. Never mind.

KRAMER: I got enough to get to Memphis.
KRAMER: I got fired from the movie.
KRAMER: I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
KRAMER: I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
KRAMER: I got it at Joes.
KRAMER: I got it! This time, I got it!
KRAMER: I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma.
KRAMER: I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
KRAMER: I got it. Yep.
KRAMER: I got mugged.
KRAMER: I got news for you: handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
KRAMER: I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.

KRAMER: I guess she was hot.
KRAMER: I guess.
KRAMER: I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
KRAMER: I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
KRAMER: I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
KRAMER: I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
KRAMER: I have a pen.
KRAMER: I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
KRAMER: I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... ...I get up!

KRAMER: I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
KRAMER: I I I
KRAMER: I just assume not sit next to you.
KRAMER: I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
KRAMER: I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
KRAMER: I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
KRAMER: I just can't get over how fantastic you look.

KRAMER: I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
KRAMER: I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
KRAMER: I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
KRAMER: I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
KRAMER: I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
KRAMER: I knew you would.
KRAMER: I know but I... Little problem.
KRAMER: I know how to handle these psychotics.
KRAMER: I know how to sign.
KRAMER: I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
KRAMER: I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
KRAMER: I know that guy...
KRAMER: I know what I'm gonna say.
KRAMER: I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
KRAMER: I know where I?m standing.
KRAMER: I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
KRAMER: I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
KRAMER: I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
KRAMER: I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
KRAMER: I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
KRAMER: I know, it's a long story.
KRAMER: I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless.
KRAMER: I know, Jerry. It's okay. Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
KRAMER: I know.

KRAMER: I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
KRAMER: I like 'em all
KRAMER: I like mangos.

KRAMER: I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
KRAMER: I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
KRAMER: I like to strain the sauce.
KRAMER: I like what you've done with that.
KRAMER: I liked Marlene. Whats her number?
KRAMER: I live for Merlot.
KRAMER: I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
KRAMER: I lost my balance.
KRAMER: I love her!
KRAMER: I love her, Jerry!
KRAMER: I love you, too, buddy, and George--
KRAMER: I made a mistake.
KRAMER: I may be old, but I'm spry.
KRAMER: I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin'?
KRAMER: I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
KRAMER: I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
KRAMER: I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
KRAMER: I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
KRAMER: I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
KRAMER: I must know.
KRAMER: I need the yield sign.
KRAMER: I need to talk to you.
KRAMER: I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
KRAMER: I never had an air conditioner.
KRAMER: I never take it.
KRAMER: I never thought I'd live to see that..
KRAMER: I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
KRAMER: I only got hundreds.
KRAMER: I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
KRAMER: I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
KRAMER: I put them on a dental chair.
KRAMER: I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
KRAMER: I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
KRAMER: I said  Jump. Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said  Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me. At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
KRAMER: I said  Wave to me when you pass my window.
KRAMER: I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
KRAMER: I said how come it's takin' so long?
KRAMER: I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
KRAMER: I saw a couple of other guys out there.
KRAMER: I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
KRAMER: I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
KRAMER: I saw the whole thing!
KRAMER: I say Japan.
KRAMER: I say we get him.
KRAMER: I see.
KRAMER: I see..
KRAMER: I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
KRAMER: I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
KRAMER: I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
KRAMER: I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
KRAMER: I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
KRAMER: I sure am.
KRAMER: I sure am.
KRAMER: I take baths.
KRAMER: I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
KRAMER: I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. I'll be right back.
KRAMER: I tell you how much I make.
KRAMER: I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
KRAMER: I tell you.
KRAMER: I think he looks fantastic.
KRAMER: I think I gotta go to the doctor! Oh, mama!
KRAMER: I think I hit my head again!
KRAMER: I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
KRAMER: I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
KRAMER: I think she liked me.
KRAMER: I think she was happy someone finally said it.
KRAMER: I think so too.
KRAMER: I think so.
KRAMER: I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
KRAMER: I think we are looking half a millimeter.
KRAMER: I think we lost him.
KRAMER: I think we've all experienced that.
KRAMER: I thought I DID!
KRAMER: I thought I heard you.
KRAMER: I thought it was a closet.
KRAMER: I thought it was here.
KRAMER: I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
KRAMER: I thought paper covered rock?
KRAMER: I thought she was pregnant.
KRAMER: I thought we had a deal?
KRAMER: I thought we were friends...
KRAMER: I thought we were talking about me.
KRAMER: I thought we would blend in.
KRAMER: I thought you said it was a scratch.
KRAMER: I thought you said she stinks
KRAMER: I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
KRAMER: I thought you took the test.
KRAMER: I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
KRAMER: I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
KRAMER: I told ya.
KRAMER: I told you he could do it.
KRAMER: I told you I sold them to Bania.
KRAMER: I told you I was gonna get it.
KRAMER: I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
KRAMER: I told you she liked me.
KRAMER: I told you this is all I got.
KRAMER: I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
KRAMER: I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
KRAMER: I told you, I threw it out.
KRAMER: I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
KRAMER: I told you.
KRAMER: I told you.
KRAMER: I too am well.
KRAMER: I took these out of every single garment in the store.
KRAMER: I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
KRAMER: I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
KRAMER: I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
KRAMER: I used to have a problem. Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
KRAMER: I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
KRAMER: I wanna be a pirate.
KRAMER: I wanna see it.
KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner!
KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
KRAMER: I want one of those!
KRAMER: I want restitution.
KRAMER: I want to capture this.
KRAMER: I want to talk to Calvin.
KRAMER: I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
KRAMER: I was all dirty!
KRAMER: I was going to dump this.
KRAMER: I was never able to become a banker.
KRAMER: I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
KRAMER: I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
KRAMER: I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
KRAMER: I was very upset that day.
KRAMER: I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
KRAMER: I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
KRAMER: I went back with Ellen.
KRAMER: I went down to Madeline's. I told her, You gotta move, or it's over.
KRAMER: I will lose that nail.
KRAMER: I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
KRAMER: I wish you never mentioned it to ME.
KRAMER: I won't!
KRAMER: I would advise against that.
KRAMER: I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
KRAMER: I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
KRAMER: I wouldn't walk over there.
KRAMER: I wouldnt set foot in your house.
KRAMER: I yearn.
KRAMER: I'd like to get some coffee.
KRAMER: I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
KRAMER: I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
KRAMER: I'd love to help you move.
KRAMER: I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!
KRAMER: I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
KRAMER: I'll be down in a minute.
KRAMER: I'll bet I can guess it.
KRAMER: I'll break.
KRAMER: I'll bring back the pot.
KRAMER: I'll do anything.
KRAMER: I'll do it.
KRAMER: I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
KRAMER: I'll get the shovel.
KRAMER: I'll go get your hat, George.
KRAMER: I'll go.
KRAMER: I'll have a brewsky, Charlie.
KRAMER: I'll just squeeze in...
KRAMER: I'll let her down easy. All right. Well, hi Olive. No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
KRAMER: I'll pick her up.
KRAMER: I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
KRAMER: I'll see you tonight, huh? Forget my briefcase.
KRAMER: I'll show ya Rusty.

KRAMER: I'll tell you when it's enough! Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
KRAMER: I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
KRAMER: I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'
KRAMER: I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
KRAMER: I'm a guest of honor.
KRAMER: I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
KRAMER: I'm all ticklish.
KRAMER: I'm asking you!
KRAMER: I'm at the airport.
KRAMER: I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
KRAMER: I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.

KRAMER: I'm the babysitter
KRAMER: I'm the real Peterman.
KRAMER: I'm trying. {hard to make out}

KRAMER: I've been thinking about something.
KRAMER: I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes Hey, come here, come here, take a look at this.
KRAMER: I've got plenty of ideas.
KRAMER: I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
KRAMER: I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
KRAMER: I've had it with 'em.
KRAMER: I've made an important life decision.
KRAMER: I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
KRAMER: I, I saw her naked.
KRAMER: I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.
KRAMER: I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
KRAMER: I...um...ei...
KRAMER: If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
KRAMER: If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
KRAMER: If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
KRAMER: If it's a dime a day it could be $100, 000
KRAMER: If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
KRAMER: If only I could say things like that around her.
KRAMER: If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.
KRAMER: If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
KRAMER: If they're real, that's Rushdie.
KRAMER: If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
KRAMER: If you like her, go talk to her.
KRAMER: If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
KRAMER: iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
KRAMER: Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say Hey, Carl! and he says Hey, Jerry! You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
KRAMER: In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
KRAMER: In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
KRAMER: In my spare time. . You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
KRAMER: Independence Day?
KRAMER: Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
KRAMER: Is Elaine going?
KRAMER: Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
KRAMER: Is it over four hundred?
KRAMER: Is it? Look at this.
KRAMER: Is that a problem?
KRAMER: Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
KRAMER: Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
KRAMER: Is that from Henry the Eighth?
KRAMER: Is that seat taken?
KRAMER: Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
KRAMER: Is there a tree?
KRAMER: Is thi oak?
KRAMER: Is this a joke?
KRAMER: Is this the interference?
KRAMER: Is too.
KRAMER: Is too.
KRAMER: Is your name Ray?
KRAMER: Is, uh, David Puddy there?
KRAMER: It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
KRAMER: It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
KRAMER: It changes the molecules.
KRAMER: It felt like 8 seconds.
KRAMER: It is very obtrusive.
KRAMER: It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
KRAMER: It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
KRAMER: It might be. I mean whatever you want.
KRAMER: It must have been the botanical extracts.
KRAMER: It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
KRAMER: It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.
KRAMER: It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
KRAMER: it was a big rock
KRAMER: It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.
KRAMER: It was about 1200 bucks.
KRAMER: It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
KRAMER: It was an accident.
KRAMER: It was an accident.
KRAMER: It was easy the last time.
KRAMER: It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
KRAMER: It was in my laundry.
KRAMER: It was on the seat...
KRAMER: It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
KRAMER: It was supposed to erupt.
KRAMER: It was there!
KRAMER: It was under a spoon!
KRAMER: it was your fault
KRAMER: It will be a funky adventure.
KRAMER: It would put me at ease.
KRAMER: It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
KRAMER: It'll take you ten seconds.
KRAMER: It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
KRAMER: It's a business.
KRAMER: It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
KRAMER: It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
KRAMER: It's a method, Jerry. It's intense.
KRAMER: It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
KRAMER: It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
KRAMER: It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
KRAMER: It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
KRAMER: It's a poker game... And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
KRAMER: It's a sweater.
KRAMER: It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
KRAMER: It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
KRAMER: It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
KRAMER: It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
KRAMER: It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
KRAMER: It's all attitude..
KRAMER: It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
KRAMER: It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
KRAMER: It's also playing in theater number two at 9:00.
KRAMER: It's an eyepatch.
KRAMER: It's architecturally incorrect.
KRAMER: It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
KRAMER: It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
KRAMER: It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.
KRAMER: It's cucumbers.
KRAMER: It's definitely preposterous.
KRAMER: It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
KRAMER: It's good suspension!
KRAMER: It's got an alarm that beeps!
KRAMER: It's got to be here.
KRAMER: It's Grossbard!
KRAMER: It's Halloween

KRAMER: it's in my book - Astonishing Tales of the Sea 51 people died.
KRAMER: It's Jell-O.
KRAMER: It's just a write off for them.
KRAMER: It's just me.
KRAMER: It's just Original, Jerry!
KRAMER: It's just...it's no picnic.
KRAMER: It's Keith.
KRAMER: It's Kramer!
KRAMER: It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.

KRAMER: It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it
KRAMER: It's me!
KRAMER: It's my mom's.
KRAMER: It's my stomach.
KRAMER: It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
KRAMER: It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble.
KRAMER: It's not going to happen again!
KRAMER: It's not illegal.
KRAMER: It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.
KRAMER: It's over!
KRAMER: It's Pagliacci!
KRAMER: It's Pam.

KRAMER: It's sad, Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
KRAMER: It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
KRAMER: It's terrible!
KRAMER: It's the Merv Griffin set.
KRAMER: It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
KRAMER: It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
KRAMER: It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
KRAMER: It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
KRAMER: It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
KRAMER: It's this way.
KRAMER: It's too busy
KRAMER: It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
KRAMER: It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
KRAMER: It's very refreshing!
KRAMER: It's weighing on my conscience.
KRAMER: It's yellow mustard. Can you break a twenty?
KRAMER: It's your first time. He'll understand.
KRAMER: Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
KRAMER: Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
KRAMER: Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
KRAMER: Its all supervised.
KRAMER: Its beautiful.
KRAMER: Its for you.
KRAMER: Its funny.
KRAMER: Its gonna be hot in a minute.
KRAMER: Its good to have you back, Stan.
KRAMER: Its over four hundred?
KRAMER: Its the best cantaloupe I ever had.
KRAMER: Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
KRAMER: Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
KRAMER: Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch.
KRAMER: Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
KRAMER: Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
KRAMER: Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
KRAMER: Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
KRAMER: Im human.
KRAMER: Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.

KRAMER: Jerry . . .
KRAMER: Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
KRAMER: Jerry he's a conductor.
KRAMER: Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me. OH! Mother!!!
KRAMER: Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...
KRAMER: Jerry this peach is sub par.
KRAMER: Jerry too, of course.
KRAMER: Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
KRAMER: Jerry what's the matter?
KRAMER: Jerry you in there?
KRAMER: Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
KRAMER: Jerry!
KRAMER: Jerry!
KRAMER: Jerry!
KRAMER: Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.
KRAMER: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look..
KRAMER: Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
KRAMER: Jerry! What?!
KRAMER: Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
KRAMER: Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
KRAMER: Jerry, aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
KRAMER: Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
KRAMER: Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
KRAMER: Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
KRAMER: Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
KRAMER: Jerry, check this out. Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
KRAMER: Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
KRAMER: Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
KRAMER: Jerry, come on. What'd you say?
KRAMER: Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
KRAMER: Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
KRAMER: Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
KRAMER: Jerry, George got arrested.
KRAMER: Jerry, George!
KRAMER: Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
KRAMER: Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
KRAMER: Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
KRAMER: Jerry, he probably had a cold.
KRAMER: Jerry, how about you?
KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing!
KRAMER: Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
KRAMER: Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
KRAMER: Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
KRAMER: Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. What's going on!?
KRAMER: Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
KRAMER: Jerry, I left you a pair right here... C'mon. There, put on those boots.
KRAMER: Jerry, I need another massage!
KRAMER: Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
KRAMER: Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
KRAMER: Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
KRAMER: Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
KRAMER: Jerry, I'll take care of it.
KRAMER: Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look . You gotta call her, the voice she uses..
KRAMER: Jerry, if the man is in pain...
KRAMER: Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
KRAMER: Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
KRAMER: Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
KRAMER: Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
KRAMER: Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.
KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!
KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!

KRAMER: Jerry, karate is not here . It's here, and here, and here .
KRAMER: Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
KRAMER: Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
KRAMER: Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
KRAMER: Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
KRAMER: Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
KRAMER: Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
KRAMER: Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
KRAMER: Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
KRAMER: Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
KRAMER: Jerry, she taped over the whole ending!
KRAMER: Jerry, she's a loser.
KRAMER: Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
KRAMER: Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
KRAMER: Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
KRAMER: Jerry, that's in Sweden.
KRAMER: Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
KRAMER: Jerry, the whole building is brick.
KRAMER: Jerry, this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
KRAMER: Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
KRAMER: Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
KRAMER: Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
KRAMER: Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
KRAMER: Jerry, what is your problem?
KRAMER: Jerry, where are all the tote bags?
KRAMER: Jerry, where have you been?
KRAMER: Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
KRAMER: Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
KRAMER: Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
KRAMER: Jerry, you forgot your purse.
KRAMER: Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. You're just being totally ridiculous. I'll see you later buddy.
KRAMER: Jerry, you gotta help me!
KRAMER: Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
KRAMER: Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
KRAMER: Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
KRAMER: Jerry, you should pay that price.
KRAMER: Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
KRAMER: Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
KRAMER: Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
KRAMER: Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
KRAMER: Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
KRAMER: Jerry.
KRAMER: Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
KRAMER: Jerry. Hey Jerry?
KRAMER: Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
KRAMER: Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
KRAMER: Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
KRAMER: Jerry. Uh, can we talk?
KRAMER: Jerry...
KRAMER: Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
KRAMER: Jerry.... hey Jeannie.

KRAMER: Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
KRAMER: Jerry? Jerry!
KRAMER: Jimmy leg.
KRAMER: Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.

KRAMER: Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
KRAMER: Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet masculine.
KRAMER: Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
KRAMER: Let's try a few more questions, alright? If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
KRAMER: Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
KRAMER: Lets share.. we share....Awight
KRAMER: Lets go get him.
KRAMER: Lets see what Jerry has to eat.

KRAMER: No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
KRAMER: No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
KRAMER: No I think he's got you beat buddy.
KRAMER: No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.

KRAMER: No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
KRAMER: No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
KRAMER: No sweat.
KRAMER: No that's what he said. That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup. So do I.
KRAMER: No time!
KRAMER: No way I'm taking fifteen.
KRAMER: No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
KRAMER: No way!
KRAMER: No you can't, Jerry.
KRAMER: No!
KRAMER: No! Don't!
KRAMER: No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
KRAMER: No! I'm not the Assman.
KRAMER: No! Jerry! Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
KRAMER: No! She needs it now!
KRAMER: No, a thousand!

KRAMER: No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
KRAMER: No, blame me.
KRAMER: No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.

KRAMER: No, don't, don't make me
KRAMER: No, five. But you were close.
KRAMER: No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You!
KRAMER: No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
KRAMER: NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
KRAMER: No, I can't, all right I can't ...
KRAMER: No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
KRAMER: No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. Look.
KRAMER: No, I didn't make these bagels. Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
KRAMER: No, I didn't see him.
KRAMER: No, I don't think so.
KRAMER: No, I don't want it back.
KRAMER: No, I dunno how much duty is.
KRAMER: No, I fled the scene.
KRAMER: No, I got 'em in the ocean.
KRAMER: No, I got a girl in the next building
KRAMER: No, I got dibs!
KRAMER: No, I got the tape right here.

KRAMER: No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!
KRAMER: No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
KRAMER: No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. I'll see you later.
KRAMER: No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
KRAMER: No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
KRAMER: No, I swear.
KRAMER: No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
KRAMER: No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
KRAMER: No, I want to show you.
KRAMER: No, I want to speak to the manager.
KRAMER: No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
KRAMER: No, I want you to see me naked.
KRAMER: No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
KRAMER: No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
KRAMER: No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
KRAMER: No, I'm not going to let this happen.
KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
KRAMER: No, I'm the baby-sitter.
KRAMER: No, it didn't say anything.
KRAMER: No, it doesn't work.
KRAMER: No, it isn't!
KRAMER: No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
KRAMER: No, it's just too much.
KRAMER: No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
KRAMER: No, it's statue.
KRAMER: No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
KRAMER: No, Im good.
KRAMER: No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
KRAMER: No, Jerry!
KRAMER: No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
KRAMER: No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
KRAMER: No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
KRAMER: No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
KRAMER: No, Julie. She's the one.
KRAMER: No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. I'll seal that up later, right?
KRAMER: No, lets go to the couch...
KRAMER: No, man! Not the gas!
KRAMER: No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
KRAMER: No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.
KRAMER: No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
KRAMER: No, my throat's too tender.
KRAMER: No, no I can't comprehend it?
KRAMER: No, no I don't find him all that bright.
KRAMER: No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
KRAMER: No, no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
KRAMER: No, No You said Hey!
KRAMER: No, no! My car's not running.
KRAMER: No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
KRAMER: No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
KRAMER: No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
KRAMER: No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
KRAMER: No, no, I don't want it back. Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
KRAMER: No, no, I got it.
KRAMER: No, no, I would turn you in.
KRAMER: No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
KRAMER: No, no, I'm off that.
KRAMER: No, no, I'm working on it.
KRAMER: No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. May I have one of those, madam?
KRAMER: No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. My boys need a house!
KRAMER: No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
KRAMER: No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
KRAMER: No, no, no, I didnt.
KRAMER: No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.

KRAMER: No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think: Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off? And now that wish's come true, and you want to throw it away?!

KRAMER: No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.

KRAMER: No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
KRAMER: No, we're in the same class.
KRAMER: No, we've already eaten.
KRAMER: No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
KRAMER: No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
KRAMER: No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
KRAMER: No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
KRAMER: No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.
KRAMER: No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.

KRAMER: Oh, all right.
KRAMER: Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.
KRAMER: Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
KRAMER: Oh, alrighty uh...
KRAMER: Oh, and that voice!
KRAMER: Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
KRAMER: Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
KRAMER: Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
KRAMER: Oh, boy.
KRAMER: Oh, boy.
KRAMER: Oh, boy.
KRAMER: Oh, boy.
KRAMER: Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
KRAMER: Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
KRAMER: Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
KRAMER: Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
KRAMER: Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
KRAMER: Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
KRAMER: Oh, COME ON!

KRAMER: Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
KRAMER: Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
KRAMER: Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
KRAMER: Oh, come on, they don't drive!
KRAMER: Oh, come on.
KRAMER: Oh, come on.
KRAMER: Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
KRAMER: Oh, congratulations.

KRAMER: Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the Big Mammoo. Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
KRAMER: Oh, God.
KRAMER: Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
KRAMER: Oh, great ride.

KRAMER: Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. I've always had a thing for Noreen.
KRAMER: Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath!
KRAMER: Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
KRAMER: Oh, hey,

KRAMER: Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?
KRAMER: Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..

KRAMER: Oh, hi Elaine, hey. Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
KRAMER: Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
KRAMER: Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
KRAMER: Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
KRAMER: Oh, I can wait..
KRAMER: Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break.
KRAMER: Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.
KRAMER: Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
KRAMER: Oh, I forgot.
KRAMER: Oh, I get by.
KRAMER: Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
KRAMER: Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
KRAMER: Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
KRAMER: Oh, I gotcha
KRAMER: Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright
KRAMER: Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
KRAMER: Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.
KRAMER: Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.
KRAMER: Oh, I love curls.
KRAMER: Oh, I love the one they do right after this one!
KRAMER: Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great!
KRAMER: Oh, I really think you're wrong.
KRAMER: Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
KRAMER: Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that...
KRAMER: Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
KRAMER: Oh, I'll be back.
KRAMER: Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog - all on the same day.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm jiff.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm the real deal.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!
KRAMER: Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.
KRAMER: Oh, I'm with him.
KRAMER: Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
KRAMER: Oh, I, I need a pen.
KRAMER: Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
KRAMER: Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
KRAMER: Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
KRAMER: Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees!
KRAMER: Oh, it's a birthday card.
KRAMER: Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
KRAMER: Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
KRAMER: Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
KRAMER: Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
KRAMER: Oh, it's on file, right here.
KRAMER: Oh, it's true.
KRAMER: Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.
KRAMER: Oh, Ill be comfortable.
KRAMER: Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, put it out of your mind.
KRAMER: Oh, Jerry loves the morning.
KRAMER: Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!
KRAMER: Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
KRAMER: Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?
KRAMER: Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?
KRAMER: Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
KRAMER: Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
KRAMER: Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right
KRAMER: Oh, like you're gonna stop?
KRAMER: Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
KRAMER: Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.
KRAMER: Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
KRAMER: Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
KRAMER: Oh, lots of 'em.
KRAMER: Oh, Mama.
KRAMER: Oh, mama.
KRAMER: Oh, mama...
KRAMER: Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.. What, you want my kidney? Mama!..
KRAMER: Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.
KRAMER: Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
KRAMER: Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
KRAMER: Oh, man... If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner. Never, I can't do that.
KRAMER: Oh, memory burn.
KRAMER: Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
KRAMER: Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
KRAMER: Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
KRAMER: Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
KRAMER: Oh, no you don't.
KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
KRAMER: Oh, no, no. Here, velcro.
KRAMER: Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
KRAMER: Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
KRAMER: Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
KRAMER: Oh, no.
KRAMER: Oh, no. I don't wear a watch.
KRAMER: Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
KRAMER: Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
KRAMER: Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
KRAMER: Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
KRAMER: Oh, not a problem.
KRAMER: Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
KRAMER: Oh, oh well say hello for me.
KRAMER: Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.
KRAMER: Oh, oh, the paper..
KRAMER: Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.
KRAMER: Oh, Queensboro Plaza. This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
KRAMER: Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
KRAMER: Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
KRAMER: Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
KRAMER: Oh, so far, so good... yeuye...
KRAMER: Oh, so he took you back.
KRAMER: Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
KRAMER: Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
KRAMER: Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
KRAMER: Oh, stop saying 'reneging.
KRAMER: Oh, stop stalling. Come on.
KRAMER: Oh, tell me about it.
KRAMER: Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
KRAMER: Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...

KRAMER: Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
KRAMER: Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
KRAMER: Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
KRAMER: Oh, that's my phone.
KRAMER: Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
KRAMER: Oh, that's right.
KRAMER: Oh, that's too bad.
KRAMER: Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
KRAMER: Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
KRAMER: Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
KRAMER: Oh, the one with the crest.

KRAMER: Oh, we go back a ways.
KRAMER: Oh, we have to do this now.
KRAMER: Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.

KRAMER: Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
KRAMER: Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss?
KRAMER: Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
KRAMER: Sorry.
KRAMER: Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
KRAMER: South America?
KRAMER: South America?
KRAMER: Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
KRAMER: Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
KRAMER: Spleenectomy.
KRAMER: Squamous cell carcinoma.
KRAMER: Ssssh--ah! They just closed!
KRAMER: Stay strong buddy.
KRAMER: Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
KRAMER: Stefanie. 2-G.
KRAMER: Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...
KRAMER: Steve Gendason.
KRAMER: Steven.
KRAMER: Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
KRAMER: Stop right there.
KRAMER: Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
KRAMER: Sue her?
KRAMER: Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
KRAMER: Sure do!
KRAMER: Sure do.
KRAMER: Sure Mrs. Anvino, ya.
KRAMER: Sure you can. Such a sweet kid.
KRAMER: Sure you do.
KRAMER: Sure you have.
KRAMER: Sure, do you need a glove?
KRAMER: Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
KRAMER: Sure.
KRAMER: Sure. I will.
KRAMER: Surely you jest.
KRAMER: Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!
KRAMER: Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
KRAMER: T-t-t-t...
KRAMER: T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
KRAMER: Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
KRAMER: Take it.
KRAMER: Take me where? Where?
KRAMER: Talk to him.
KRAMER: Talk to me baby.
KRAMER: Talk to me.
KRAMER: Talkin' to that woman.
KRAMER: Tantric yoga?
KRAMER: Tape her breasts together.
KRAMER: Taste this.
KRAMER: Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage.
KRAMER: Tell me about it!
KRAMER: Tell me about it.
KRAMER: Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
KRAMER: Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
KRAMER: Thank - you!
KRAMER: Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
KRAMER: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
KRAMER: Thank you.
KRAMER: Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.
KRAMER: Thanks buddy.
KRAMER: Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.
KRAMER: Thanks man.
KRAMER: Thanks, buddy.
KRAMER: Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
KRAMER: Thanks.
KRAMER: Thanks. Have a good day.
KRAMER: That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
KRAMER: That don't make you look high-waisted.
KRAMER: That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
KRAMER: That guy.. He was just...
KRAMER: That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
KRAMER: That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
KRAMER: That kid is gonna be all right.
KRAMER: That kid...
KRAMER: That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
KRAMER: That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
KRAMER: That makes me the premiere.
KRAMER: That might be a problem. Where's your little bag of...
KRAMER: That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
KRAMER: That musta been some kind of doll.
KRAMER: That smell. What's that smell?
KRAMER: That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
KRAMER: That was alright.
KRAMER: That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
KRAMER: That was the wrong card.
KRAMER: That wasn't me!
KRAMER: That you Bobby?
KRAMER: That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
KRAMER: That's a fallacy.
KRAMER: That's a lotta yearning, huh?
KRAMER: That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma. Hey George hey.
KRAMER: That's a nice triangle...
KRAMER: That's a nipple.
KRAMER: That's a....ca.....ca..........Condom!!
KRAMER: That's all I got.
KRAMER: That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
KRAMER: That's better than we estimated.
KRAMER: That's caged heat.
KRAMER: That's correct.
KRAMER: That's East River.
KRAMER: That's fine.
KRAMER: That's for radiation.
KRAMER: That's good thinking.
KRAMER: That's good work.
KRAMER: That's gunna be trouble.
KRAMER: that's her
KRAMER: That's her, officer.
KRAMER: That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on, work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
KRAMER: That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
KRAMER: That's it.
KRAMER: That's it.
KRAMER: That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
KRAMER: That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
KRAMER: That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
KRAMER: That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
KRAMER: That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
KRAMER: That's NBC.
KRAMER: That's nice..
KRAMER: That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
KRAMER: That's perfect.
KRAMER: That's perfect. Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
KRAMER: That's pretty good, huh?
KRAMER: That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
KRAMER: That's queer uh?
KRAMER: That's right
KRAMER: That's right I don't like, I never like her from the get-go.
KRAMER: That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
KRAMER: That's right, 'cause they already saw it.
KRAMER: That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
KRAMER: That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
KRAMER: That's right.
KRAMER: That's right.
KRAMER: That's right.
KRAMER: That's right.
KRAMER: That's right.
KRAMER: That's right. He's a troublemaker.
KRAMER: That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
KRAMER: that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now.
KRAMER: That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
KRAMER: That's the idea.
KRAMER: That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
KRAMER: That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
KRAMER: That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
KRAMER: That's true.
KRAMER: That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
KRAMER: That's true. That's right.
KRAMER: That's true.. I'll be right back.
KRAMER: That's weird.
KRAMER: That's what I intend to find out.
KRAMER: That's what I wanna know.
KRAMER: That's what they gave me.
KRAMER: That's your problem, buddy.
KRAMER: That's... even better!
KRAMER: That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
KRAMER: That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
KRAMER: Thats as good as anything you do.
KRAMER: Thats definitely you.
KRAMER: Thats for me. Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
KRAMER: Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?
KRAMER: Thats okay. He doesnt care.
KRAMER: Thats you.
KRAMER: The *beach*!
KRAMER: The AC is on it's way.
KRAMER: The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
KRAMER: The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
KRAMER: The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
KRAMER: The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket.
KRAMER: The Ball, silly.
KRAMER: The bank can pay 'em.
KRAMER: The bathroom scene.
KRAMER: THE BEACH!!!
KRAMER: The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
KRAMER: The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
KRAMER: The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
KRAMER: The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
KRAMER: The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
KRAMER: The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!
KRAMER: The coffee was too hot.
KRAMER: The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
KRAMER: The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
KRAMER: The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
KRAMER: The discount pharmacy?
KRAMER: The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
KRAMER: The door's on a diagonal.
KRAMER: The door.
KRAMER: The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
KRAMER: The factory?
KRAMER: The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
KRAMER: The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious.
KRAMER: The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
KRAMER: The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
KRAMER: The haunting memories of lost love. May I? Lights? Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
KRAMER: The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
KRAMER: The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
KRAMER: The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
KRAMER: The little man knows all.
KRAMER: The lure of the animal. Im dangerous.
KRAMER: The MACANAW PEACHES, Jerry, the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
KRAMER: The machine. You want one?
KRAMER: The Maestro.
KRAMER: The monkey.
KRAMER: The name on the boat. Look at it.
KRAMER: The Netherlands?
KRAMER: The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
KRAMER: The only way to fly.
KRAMER: The party, Long Island?
KRAMER: The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
KRAMER: The pharmacy's still open.
KRAMER: The Place To Be!
KRAMER: The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
KRAMER: The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
KRAMER: The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
KRAMER: the rock
KRAMER: The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
KRAMER: The sand, it's everywhere!
KRAMER: The slicer! Elaine, let's go.
KRAMER: The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
KRAMER: The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
KRAMER: The tobacco companies.
KRAMER: The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.
KRAMER: The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
KRAMER: The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
KRAMER: The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
KRAMER: The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry ... Wood.
KRAMER: The wire was sticking out.. Yeah.
KRAMER: The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
KRAMER: The woman is a menace.
KRAMER: The work piled up, I lost track of time--
KRAMER: Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
KRAMER: Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
KRAMER: Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!
KRAMER: Then I'll be back.
KRAMER: Then we're cool.
KRAMER: Then why the sniffing? Who walks around sniffing?
KRAMER: There are no delicatessens under Communism.
KRAMER: There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.
KRAMER: There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
KRAMER: There they are.
KRAMER: There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
KRAMER: There was an incident.
KRAMER: There was no plan.
KRAMER: There were 1, 650 survivors.

KRAMER: There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
KRAMER: There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
KRAMER: There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
KRAMER: There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
KRAMER: There's Marcelino.
KRAMER: There's no candy around here. hey! Jimmy.
KRAMER: There's no problem, really.
KRAMER: There's no water pressure.
KRAMER: There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
KRAMER: There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman .
KRAMER: There's nothing to be nervous about.
KRAMER: There's Salman.
KRAMER: There, there's your hives.
KRAMER: There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
KRAMER: Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
KRAMER: Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the E.
KRAMER: These are Cubans. Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
KRAMER: These are great seats huh?
KRAMER: These are my friends Jerry and Elaine.
KRAMER: These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
KRAMER: These pretzels are making me thirsty. Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
KRAMER: These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
KRAMER: These street toughs, they robbed me.
KRAMER: They gave them all to Goodwill.
KRAMER: They got you too?
KRAMER: They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
KRAMER: They just write it off.
KRAMER: They moved in together?
KRAMER: They should be sent to Australia.
KRAMER: They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
KRAMER: They want to know why they never see you.
KRAMER: They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
KRAMER: They wont take a cage full of birds.
KRAMER: They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
KRAMER: They're all looking up.
KRAMER: They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
KRAMER: They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
KRAMER: They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
KRAMER: They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
KRAMER: They're ladies' glasses.
KRAMER: They're never in contention.
KRAMER: They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.
KRAMER: They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
KRAMER: They're Plyometric.
KRAMER: They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
KRAMER: They're right out here.
KRAMER: They're trying to screw with your head.
KRAMER: They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
KRAMER: Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
KRAMER: This doesn't look familiar to you?
KRAMER: This food, it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'... It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......
KRAMER: This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
KRAMER: This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
KRAMER: This hallway smells like potatoes.
KRAMER: This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
KRAMER: This is a good cigar . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . .
KRAMER: This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
KRAMER: This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
KRAMER: This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
KRAMER: This is the best way to go!
KRAMER: This is tomato juice, look...
KRAMER: This mango is delicious!
KRAMER: This ramp is steep.
KRAMER: This slicer is indomitable.
KRAMER: This truck is dying. We're losing him.
KRAMER: This umpf thing.
KRAMER: This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
KRAMER: This was in front of your door.
KRAMER: This was set for 2 minutes. See?
KRAMER: Those kids look pretty disappointed.
KRAMER: Those people, listen to yourself.
KRAMER: Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
KRAMER: Three quarters of a tank.
KRAMER: Three under par.
KRAMER: To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.
KRAMER: To pull the rickshaw.
KRAMER: To the Kramennium.
KRAMER: To the whole scene.
KRAMER: Toby! Oh, Oh!

KRAMER: Tony.
KRAMER: Too bad you got engaged.
KRAMER: Too much?!
KRAMER: Toxic gas!!!
KRAMER: Tryin' to save a quarter.
KRAMER: Tuesday? Uh...
KRAMER: Tupperware.
KRAMER: Turn on the TV.
KRAMER: Two and a half points.
KRAMER: Two is better than one.
KRAMER: Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
KRAMER: Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.

KRAMER: Uh, Dwayne.
KRAMER: Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
KRAMER: Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
KRAMER: Uh, habla ingles?
KRAMER: Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.
KRAMER: Uh, hey buddy.
KRAMER: Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
KRAMER: Uh, I didn't see him.
KRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
KRAMER: Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
KRAMER: Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
KRAMER: Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
KRAMER: Uh, Kramer.
KRAMER: Uh, let's see... well.

KRAMER: Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
KRAMER: Uh, no thanks.
KRAMER: Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.
KRAMER: Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
KRAMER: Uh, no, no, not yet.
KRAMER: Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
KRAMER: Uh, no.
KRAMER: Uh, no.

KRAMER: Uh, Pantene.
KRAMER: Uh, see here, I.. I saved one of the cigar rings..
KRAMER: Uh, Swiss.
KRAMER: Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
KRAMER: Uh, uh.
KRAMER: Uh, Varnsen.
KRAMER: Uh, well there was an incident.
KRAMER: Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
KRAMER: Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said: 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
KRAMER: Uh, well, there's someone else.
KRAMER: Uh, well, uh, we --
KRAMER: Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
KRAMER: Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah, ah ...
KRAMER: Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.

KRAMER: Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
KRAMER: Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
KRAMER: Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
KRAMER: Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
KRAMER: Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
KRAMER: Uh, yes. Yeah.

KRAMER: We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt.
KRAMER: We're gonna be right there.
KRAMER: We're making sausages.

KRAMER: Well come on George, finish the story.
KRAMER: Well did you mention my name?
KRAMER: Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.

KRAMER: Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
KRAMER: Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. So, you got any black paint?
KRAMER: Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
KRAMER: Well you can go to your room and read.
KRAMER: Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
KRAMER: Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
KRAMER: Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!

KRAMER: Well you're not getting any money back. Jerry, come back in here.
KRAMER: Well!
KRAMER: Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
KRAMER: Well,
KRAMER: Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
KRAMER: Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
KRAMER: Well, ah you were right.
KRAMER: Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
KRAMER: Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
KRAMER: Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
KRAMER: Well, are you gonna wear it?
KRAMER: Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
KRAMER: Well, b -- it was stolen.
KRAMER: Well, Babe Ruth did it.
KRAMER: Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
KRAMER: Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do.
KRAMER: Well, buddy, he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
KRAMER: Well, can you call him an ambulance?
KRAMER: Well, coffee tables.
KRAMER: Well, doesn't he need that?
KRAMER: Well, don't look at me.
KRAMER: Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
KRAMER: Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
KRAMER: Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
KRAMER: Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
KRAMER: Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
KRAMER: Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved.
KRAMER: Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
KRAMER: Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
KRAMER: Well, get him to bark.
KRAMER: Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
KRAMER: Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.

KRAMER: Well, Happy Festivus.
KRAMER: Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
KRAMER: Well, he can't be disturbed now.
KRAMER: Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
KRAMER: Well, he didn't say .
KRAMER: Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
KRAMER: Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
KRAMER: Well, he started it!
KRAMER: Well, he thinks you wear those.
KRAMER: Well, he was a little standoffish.
KRAMER: Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
KRAMER: Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.
KRAMER: Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
KRAMER: Well, he's still a conductor.
KRAMER: Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
KRAMER: Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
KRAMER: Well, here's your *albums*
KRAMER: Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?
KRAMER: Well, how did they get your face?
KRAMER: Well, how do you do?
KRAMER: Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
KRAMER: Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
KRAMER: Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
KRAMER: Well, I beg to differ...
KRAMER: Well, I can guess within an hour.
KRAMER: Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
KRAMER: Well, I can't!
KRAMER: Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little out there.
KRAMER: Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.
KRAMER: Well, I couldn't find my shoes.
KRAMER: Well, I didn't believe you.
KRAMER: Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
KRAMER: Well, I didnt think ahead.
KRAMER: Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
KRAMER: Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
KRAMER: Well, I don't know what to do man!
KRAMER: Well, I don't know what to do.
KRAMER: Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
KRAMER: Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
KRAMER: Well, I don't mind if I do.
KRAMER: Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
KRAMER: Well, I don't think they're real.
KRAMER: Well, I don't want to either.
KRAMER: Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
KRAMER: Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
KRAMER: Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
KRAMER: Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
KRAMER: Well, I got gonorrhea.
KRAMER: Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
KRAMER: Well, I got the hell out of there.
KRAMER: Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
KRAMER: Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
KRAMER: Well, I gotta bring in more stuff.
KRAMER: Well, I gotta do somethin'.
KRAMER: Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
KRAMER: Well, I guess I just assumed.
KRAMER: Well, I guess I was..
KRAMER: Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
KRAMER: Well, I had some hard candy in there.
KRAMER: Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
KRAMER: Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
KRAMER: Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the old idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
KRAMER: Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
KRAMER: Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
KRAMER: Well, I havent changed my mind.
KRAMER: Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
KRAMER: Well, I just assumed you would.
KRAMER: Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
KRAMER: Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
KRAMER: Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
KRAMER: Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
KRAMER: Well, I knew him as well as she did.
KRAMER: Well, I know what they feel like.
KRAMER: Well, I like yours.
KRAMER: Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
KRAMER: Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
KRAMER: Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
KRAMER: Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
KRAMER: Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
KRAMER: Well, I overbought!
KRAMER: Well, I practically raised his kids.
KRAMER: Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.
KRAMER: Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one!
KRAMER: Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
KRAMER: Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
KRAMER: Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
KRAMER: Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
KRAMER: Well, I sold them to Bania.
KRAMER: Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
KRAMER: Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
KRAMER: Well, I tell time by the sun.
KRAMER: Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
KRAMER: Well, I think one of us should leave.
KRAMER: Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
KRAMER: Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like American Gladiators.
KRAMER: Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
KRAMER: Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
KRAMER: Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
KRAMER: Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
KRAMER: Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
KRAMER: Well, I was just trying to help out.
KRAMER: Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
KRAMER: Well, I was just--
KRAMER: Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
KRAMER: Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
KRAMER: Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
KRAMER: Well, I'd say it nicely.
KRAMER: Well, I'll check you guys out later. Ready?
KRAMER: Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
KRAMER: Well, I'll see you.
KRAMER: Well, I'm a poppa.
KRAMER: Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
KRAMER: Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
KRAMER: Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
KRAMER: Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
KRAMER: Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
KRAMER: Well, I'm gonna type it up.
KRAMER: Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
KRAMER: Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not an idiot.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
KRAMER: Well, I'm not giving it back.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
KRAMER: Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
KRAMER: Well, I'm off to the links.
KRAMER: Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
KRAMER: Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
KRAMER: Well, I'm still shopping it around.
KRAMER: Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
KRAMER: Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
KRAMER: Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
KRAMER: Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..
KRAMER: Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
KRAMER: Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
KRAMER: Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
KRAMER: Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
KRAMER: Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
KRAMER: Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
KRAMER: Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope.
KRAMER: Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
KRAMER: Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
KRAMER: Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
KRAMER: Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
KRAMER: Well, is it alright if I try it?
KRAMER: Well, is it good?
KRAMER: Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
KRAMER: Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
KRAMER: Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
KRAMER: Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
KRAMER: Well, it uh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
KRAMER: Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
KRAMER: Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.
KRAMER: Well, it's a rare archival print. Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
KRAMER: Well, it's a valuable appendage.
KRAMER: Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
KRAMER: Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything: Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
KRAMER: Well, it's chicken feed.
KRAMER: Well, it's common sense.
KRAMER: Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air.
KRAMER: Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. It's a walk out!
KRAMER: Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
KRAMER: Well, it's my final offer.
KRAMER: Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
KRAMER: Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
KRAMER: Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
KRAMER: Well, it's not really gold.
KRAMER: Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
KRAMER: Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
KRAMER: Well, It's quite a thrill.
KRAMER: Well, it's the style. Jerry give me the keys. Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
KRAMER: Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
KRAMER: Well, it's uh, common courtesy.
KRAMER: Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
KRAMER: Well, itd be our little secret.
KRAMER: Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
KRAMER: Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
KRAMER: Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. Do you mind if they use your bed? Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.
KRAMER: Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
KRAMER: Well, Ill think of something.
KRAMER: Well, Im taking this back.
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. Well, but I might have something.
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.
KRAMER: Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
KRAMER: Well, just save me a seat.
KRAMER: Well, just tell me everything, huh?
KRAMER: Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
KRAMER: Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
KRAMER: Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah.
KRAMER: Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
KRAMER: Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
KRAMER: Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
KRAMER: Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.
KRAMER: Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
KRAMER: Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
KRAMER: Well, maybe I did overextend myself.
KRAMER: Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
KRAMER: Well, maybe it's the Oreos.
KRAMER: Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
KRAMER: Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time: people are a little shy, a little reticent.
KRAMER: Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
KRAMER: Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
KRAMER: Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
KRAMER: Well, more bad news Jerry.
KRAMER: Well, move in here.
KRAMER: Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
KRAMER: Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
KRAMER: Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
KRAMER: Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
KRAMER: Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
KRAMER: Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
KRAMER: Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin.
KRAMER: Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
KRAMER: Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
KRAMER: Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
KRAMER: Well, not here.
KRAMER: Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
KRAMER: Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
KRAMER: Well, now I can't see Jerry.
KRAMER: Well, now look, just leave me alone.
KRAMER: Well, now what are we gonna do? See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
KRAMER: Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.
KRAMER: Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.
KRAMER: Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
KRAMER: Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
KRAMER: Well, please?
KRAMER: Well, she asked you.
KRAMER: Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.
KRAMER: Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
KRAMER: Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
KRAMER: Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
KRAMER: Well, thank you.
KRAMER: Well, thank you.
KRAMER: Well, thank you.
KRAMER: Well, that guy who yelled out.
KRAMER: Well, that is strange.
KRAMER: Well, that makes sense. Want some chicken?
KRAMER: Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
KRAMER: Well, that was alright, huh?
KRAMER: Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
KRAMER: Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?
KRAMER: Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
KRAMER: Well, that wouldn't be kosher.
KRAMER: Well, that's a little strange.
KRAMER: Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
KRAMER: Well, that's classified.
KRAMER: Well, that's good news.
KRAMER: Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
KRAMER: Well, that's how cats do it.
KRAMER: Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
KRAMER: Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
KRAMER: Well, that's only uh, 58 years.
KRAMER: Well, that's out of the question.
KRAMER: Well, that's peculiar.
KRAMER: Well, that's very kind of you.
KRAMER: Well, that's weird.
KRAMER: Well, that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
KRAMER: Well, the bank, I opened up a new account.
KRAMER: Well, the camp ended a few days early.
KRAMER: Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
KRAMER: Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
KRAMER: Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
KRAMER: Well, the pleasure's all mine.
KRAMER: Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he, he bolted.
KRAMER: Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
KRAMER: Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
KRAMER: Well, then I was way off!
KRAMER: Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
KRAMER: Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.
KRAMER: Well, then, he's out!
KRAMER: Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
KRAMER: Well, there is something you can do.
KRAMER: Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
KRAMER: Well, there's only one way to settle this. One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
KRAMER: Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. Three dollars, no change. You want one?
KRAMER: Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
KRAMER: Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
KRAMER: Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
KRAMER: Well, they're in...
KRAMER: Well, they're slim-fit.
KRAMER: Well, this has all been one big tease!
KRAMER: Well, this is a surprise ha?
KRAMER: Well, this is in case there's a tie!
KRAMER: Well, this is Kramer.
KRAMER: Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
KRAMER: Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.
KRAMER: Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
KRAMER: Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
KRAMER: Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
KRAMER: Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. What's worse - he has a nagging cough. Yeah, that's it. That's it.
KRAMER: Well, uh.. What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?
KRAMER: Well, um, goodnight.
KRAMER: Well, we talked about a lot of things.
KRAMER: Well, we'll have to improvise.
KRAMER: Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
KRAMER: Well, we'll see.
KRAMER: Well, we're not very close.
KRAMER: Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
KRAMER: Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--
KRAMER: Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ...
KRAMER: Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
KRAMER: Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
KRAMER: Well, what about your deal, huh?
KRAMER: Well, what am I gonna do?
KRAMER: Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
KRAMER: Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
KRAMER: Well, what are you waiting for?
KRAMER: Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
KRAMER: Well, what happened to your nose?
KRAMER: Well, what have you been doing?
KRAMER: Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
KRAMER: Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
KRAMER: Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
KRAMER: Well, what's taking you so long? Uh? Oh, well, yeah...
KRAMER: Well, what's the matter?
KRAMER: Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
KRAMER: Well, where is it?
KRAMER: Well, where the meat goes?
KRAMER: Well, where's the soup?
KRAMER: Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
KRAMER: Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
KRAMER: Well, why don't you do your material?
KRAMER: Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
KRAMER: Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
KRAMER: Well, why no T-bone?!
KRAMER: Well, why not.
KRAMER: Well, why not?
KRAMER: Well, why not?
KRAMER: Well, why not? I like cucumbers.
KRAMER: Well, why?
KRAMER: Well, would I be able to communicate?
KRAMER: Well, wow.
KRAMER: Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh.
KRAMER: Well, yeah, lets do it uh?
KRAMER: Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
KRAMER: Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... ...Dennis.
KRAMER: Well, yeah.
KRAMER: Well, yeah.
KRAMER: Well, yeah.
KRAMER: Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.
KRAMER: Well, yeah...
KRAMER: Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
KRAMER: Well, you better get on the horn.
KRAMER: Well, you better get to work.
KRAMER: Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
KRAMER: Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
KRAMER: Well, you can get 'em back.
KRAMER: Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
KRAMER: Well, you can't leave now.
KRAMER: Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
KRAMER: Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
KRAMER: Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
KRAMER: Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
KRAMER: Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
KRAMER: Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
KRAMER: Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble.
KRAMER: Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
KRAMER: Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
KRAMER: Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
KRAMER: Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
KRAMER: Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
KRAMER: Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
KRAMER: Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
KRAMER: Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
KRAMER: Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
KRAMER: Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
KRAMER: Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
KRAMER: Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines?
KRAMER: Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
KRAMER: Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
KRAMER: Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
KRAMER: Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
KRAMER: Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
KRAMER: Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
KRAMER: Well, you should, Jerry.
KRAMER: Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
KRAMER: Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
KRAMER: Well, you won't regret it.
KRAMER: Well, you'd better take it easy.
KRAMER: Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
KRAMER: Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
KRAMER: Well, you're getting heavy.
KRAMER: Well, you're going over there.
KRAMER: Well, you're not checked at on it.
KRAMER: Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
KRAMER: Well, you're not reading it now.
KRAMER: Well, you're pregnant.
KRAMER: Well, your attitude has certainly changed.
KRAMER: Well, youre still here?
KRAMER: Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
KRAMER: Well--
KRAMER: Well.
KRAMER: Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army... There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
KRAMER: Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
KRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
KRAMER: Well.. Aye can't hold the water.
KRAMER: Well...

That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?

KRAMER: Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
KRAMER: Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
KRAMER: Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
KRAMER: yeah yeah
KRAMER: Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
KRAMER: Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
KRAMER: Yeah yeah yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
KRAMER: yeah yeah, flinty
KRAMER: Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it.
KRAMER: Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
KRAMER: Yeah yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
KRAMER: Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah!
KRAMER: Yeah! And get this: I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
KRAMER: Yeah! Bunsen burner. oo ya ya.
KRAMER: Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
KRAMER: Yeah! Ha ha.
KRAMER: Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and....
KRAMER: Yeah! heading home.
KRAMER: Yeah! My lips swollen?
KRAMER: Yeah! Ooh!
KRAMER: Yeah! So people can go around saying hello to one another.
KRAMER: Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
KRAMER: Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die.
KRAMER: Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner.
KRAMER: Yeah! Well, are you going out?
KRAMER: Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y.
KRAMER: Yeah!!
KRAMER: Yeah!!!
KRAMER: Yeah,
KRAMER: Yeah,
KRAMER: Yeah, 5.
KRAMER: Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
KRAMER: Yeah, a different one.
KRAMER: Yeah, a player...
KRAMER: Yeah, a real brouhaha...
KRAMER: Yeah, about two hours.
KRAMER: Yeah, all right.
KRAMER: Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me.
KRAMER: Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
KRAMER: Yeah, alright...
KRAMER: Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
KRAMER: Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman.
KRAMER: Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
KRAMER: Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
KRAMER: Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
KRAMER: Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
KRAMER: Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
KRAMER: Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
KRAMER: Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
KRAMER: Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
KRAMER: Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them!
KRAMER: Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.
KRAMER: Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
KRAMER: Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
KRAMER: Yeah, but did you tape it?
KRAMER: Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
KRAMER: Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
KRAMER: Yeah, but I prefer the bro.
KRAMER: Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
KRAMER: Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.
KRAMER: Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
KRAMER: Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
KRAMER: Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
KRAMER: Yeah, but then I'd have to... well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
KRAMER: Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
KRAMER: Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
KRAMER: Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
KRAMER: Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.
KRAMER: Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
KRAMER: Yeah, come in.
KRAMER: Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 8:30, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, don't I know it.
KRAMER: Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
KRAMER: Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
KRAMER: Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
KRAMER: Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
KRAMER: Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all.
KRAMER: Yeah, get over.
KRAMER: Yeah, go ahead.
KRAMER: Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
KRAMER: Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
KRAMER: Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.
KRAMER: Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
KRAMER: Yeah, he was.
KRAMER: Yeah, he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
KRAMER: Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.
KRAMER: Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
KRAMER: Yeah, here it is... yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, here we go, yeah. Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat.
KRAMER: Yeah, here, Stan, in here!
KRAMER: Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
KRAMER: Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
KRAMER: Yeah, hi Elaine.
KRAMER: Yeah, how was it?
KRAMER: Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
KRAMER: Yeah, I bought a chicken.
KRAMER: Yeah, I called about the van.
KRAMER: Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
KRAMER: Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
KRAMER: Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
KRAMER: Yeah, I had a tough day
KRAMER: Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
KRAMER: Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
KRAMER: Yeah, I kissed her.
KRAMER: Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
KRAMER: Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
KRAMER: Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
KRAMER: Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
KRAMER: Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
KRAMER: Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
KRAMER: Yeah, I like that crest. Alright, here we go.
KRAMER: Yeah, I love going to the country.
KRAMER: Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
KRAMER: Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
KRAMER: Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
KRAMER: Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
KRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak.
KRAMER: Yeah, I turned up the heat.
KRAMER: Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
KRAMER: Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'll be okay.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm an extra.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm going to poke around...
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
KRAMER: Yeah, I've considered that. Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
KRAMER: Yeah, I've seen them do that.
KRAMER: Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
KRAMER: Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
KRAMER: Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
KRAMER: Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
KRAMER: Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's a disturbing image.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
KRAMER: Yeah, it's a windshield.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
KRAMER: Yeah, it's, uh, me.
KRAMER: Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
KRAMER: Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
KRAMER: Yeah, Java World wants to settle.
KRAMER: Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
KRAMER: Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
KRAMER: Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
KRAMER: Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?
KRAMER: Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
KRAMER: Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
KRAMER: Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
KRAMER: Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
KRAMER: Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...
KRAMER: Yeah, me, too.
KRAMER: Yeah, merry Christmas.
KRAMER: Yeah, morning.
KRAMER: Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
KRAMER: Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
KRAMER: Yeah, nice to meet you.
KRAMER: Yeah, no kidding.
KRAMER: Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.
KRAMER: Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
KRAMER: Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
KRAMER: Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
KRAMER: Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
KRAMER: Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
KRAMER: Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it.
KRAMER: Yeah, ok.
KRAMER: Yeah, ok. Wait. Done!
KRAMER: Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
KRAMER: Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
KRAMER: Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.
KRAMER: Yeah, put these glasses on.
KRAMER: Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. Alright, well I'm gonna go.
KRAMER: Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
KRAMER: Yeah, right...
KRAMER: Yeah, see how you're singing?
KRAMER: Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
KRAMER: Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
KRAMER: Yeah, she dumped me!
KRAMER: Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
KRAMER: Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
KRAMER: Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
KRAMER: yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
KRAMER: Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
KRAMER: Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
KRAMER: Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
KRAMER: Yeah, so whats the problem?
KRAMER: Yeah, so?
KRAMER: Yeah, so?
KRAMER: Yeah, something like that.
KRAMER: Yeah, stir it up so it melts.
KRAMER: Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
KRAMER: Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
KRAMER: Yeah, sure. Please.
KRAMER: Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
KRAMER: Yeah, that def jam is a force.
KRAMER: Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
KRAMER: Yeah, that's a hall of famer.
KRAMER: Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
KRAMER: Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
KRAMER: Yeah, that's right. You did.
KRAMER: Yeah, that's weird.
KRAMER: Yeah, that's...
KRAMER: Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
KRAMER: Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!
KRAMER: Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
KRAMER: Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
KRAMER: Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
KRAMER: Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.
KRAMER: Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
KRAMER: Yeah, there's something in the air.
KRAMER: Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
KRAMER: Yeah, they're streamlined.
KRAMER: Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
KRAMER: Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
KRAMER: Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him.
KRAMER: Yeah, those are New York plates.
KRAMER: Yeah, Tina likes the couch.
KRAMER: Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.
KRAMER: Yeah, uh.
KRAMER: Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
KRAMER: Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
KRAMER: Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.
KRAMER: Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
KRAMER: Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
KRAMER: Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
KRAMER: Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
KRAMER: Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
KRAMER: Yeah, well he started it.
KRAMER: Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
KRAMER: Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
KRAMER: Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
KRAMER: Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
KRAMER: Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
KRAMER: Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
KRAMER: Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
KRAMER: Yeah, well nothing before noon.
KRAMER: Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
KRAMER: Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
KRAMER: Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
KRAMER: Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino!
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
KRAMER: Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. Elaine!
KRAMER: Yeah, well, no good?
KRAMER: Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
KRAMER: Yeah, well, she... had one, too.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, that was a good one.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, you got that straight! Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. Real au jus sauce!
KRAMER: Yeah, went straight to video.
KRAMER: Yeah, what time is it?
KRAMER: Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
KRAMER: Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
KRAMER: Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's...
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, chew on that.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I know him.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I know. Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
KRAMER: yeah, yeah, lets do that.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, right.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, Oh, hi! Kramer! You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack? I said, Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy -  - knocked him out cold!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah...
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah...
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I think he will.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Stick. 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. Let's get this baby home.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Well, Ill think about it..
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah..
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.. what?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. Hey, you can drop me here!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?

KRAMER: You know that, uh, Leslie is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
KRAMER: You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
KRAMER: You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
KRAMER: You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
KRAMER: You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
KRAMER: You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em.
KRAMER: You know what I did? I snubbed her.
KRAMER: You know what I mean - pork, sausage, A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.

KRAMER: You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully.
KRAMER: You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
KRAMER: You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
KRAMER: You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
KRAMER: You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
KRAMER: You know who you are? Even Steven
KRAMER: You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing.
KRAMER: You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
KRAMER: You know you're going to.
KRAMER: You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
KRAMER: You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
KRAMER: You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
KRAMER: You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
KRAMER: You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
KRAMER: You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
KRAMER: You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
KRAMER: You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
KRAMER: You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
KRAMER: You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
KRAMER: You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
KRAMER: You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
KRAMER: You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.
KRAMER: You know, I faked it.
KRAMER: You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. You, are absolutely right.
KRAMER: You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
KRAMER: You know, I really like that hairdo.
KRAMER: You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
KRAMER: You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy.
KRAMER: You know, I think you're jealous.
KRAMER: You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
KRAMER: You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
KRAMER: You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
KRAMER: You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica?
KRAMER: You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup getting a call here.
KRAMER: You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
KRAMER: You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.
KRAMER: You know, maybe in Korean dog isn't an insult. Could be like the word fox to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
KRAMER: You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
KRAMER: You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
KRAMER: You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
KRAMER: You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
KRAMER: You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.
KRAMER: You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
KRAMER: You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
KRAMER: You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
KRAMER: You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
KRAMER: You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
KRAMER: You know, you should make yourself throw up.
KRAMER: You know. .
KRAMER: You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist.
KRAMER: You know? She's right.
KRAMER: You let go - come on ...
KRAMER: You looking for this?
KRAMER: You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
KRAMER: You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
KRAMER: You mean you've never tasted lobster?
KRAMER: You mind if I use it in my book?
KRAMER: You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
KRAMER: You must be kidding.
KRAMER: You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
KRAMER: You oughta get that wire fixed. I got the door.
KRAMER: You peeked!
KRAMER: You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
KRAMER: You raise the hand, lower the head-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh! You get my drift.
KRAMER: You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
KRAMER: You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
KRAMER: You recognise that mug?
KRAMER: You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
KRAMER: You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
KRAMER: You remember what they did to me ten years ago? Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one, or We'll be there between two and six! And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
KRAMER: You said it, sister.
KRAMER: You said take 'em.
KRAMER: YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
KRAMER: You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
KRAMER: You scream good.
KRAMER: You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
KRAMER: You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
KRAMER: You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
KRAMER: You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
KRAMER: You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
KRAMER: You see what happens when you try to be nice?
KRAMER: You see?
KRAMER: You see? You can't let go.
KRAMER: You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
KRAMER: You should just eat fruit.
KRAMER: You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
KRAMER: You should take cold showers.
KRAMER: You shoulda come, Jerry.
KRAMER: You shut up!
KRAMER: You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
KRAMER: You stink.
KRAMER: You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
KRAMER: You stubborn, stupid, silly man!
KRAMER: You suffer for your soup.
KRAMER: You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? Ill do it!
KRAMER: You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
KRAMER: You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
KRAMER: You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
KRAMER: You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
KRAMER: You wanna go get him?
KRAMER: You wanna go see him?
KRAMER: You wanna keep your job don't you?
KRAMER: You wanna rent a movie?
KRAMER: You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
KRAMER: You want a drink? I'm buyin'.
KRAMER: You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
KRAMER: You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.
KRAMER: You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
KRAMER: You want me to sleep with you?
KRAMER: You want some hot tea?
KRAMER: You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
KRAMER: You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
KRAMER: You want to sit here?
KRAMER: You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
KRAMER: You weren't even married yet.
KRAMER: You won't regret it. Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
KRAMER: You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
KRAMER: You'd think...
KRAMER: You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
KRAMER: You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
KRAMER: You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
KRAMER: You'll have to do a lot better than that!
KRAMER: You're *not*!!!
KRAMER: You're a chucker.
KRAMER: You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
KRAMER: You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. Hey, denty! Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
KRAMER: You're all right
KRAMER: You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon.
KRAMER: You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
KRAMER: You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
KRAMER: You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
KRAMER: You're in a weird mood.
KRAMER: You're joking.
KRAMER: You're just out for sex!!
KRAMER: You're making a big mistake.
KRAMER: You're moving to California?
KRAMER: You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. Not crazy.
KRAMER: You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
KRAMER: You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
KRAMER: You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
KRAMER: You're not pregnant?
KRAMER: You're on, cowboy!
KRAMER: You're positive it's statute?
KRAMER: You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
KRAMER: You're right he's ripping me off
KRAMER: You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
KRAMER: You're scared of Elaine?
KRAMER: You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
KRAMER: You've been married three times.
KRAMER: You've been warned.
KRAMER: You've got a message buddy.
KRAMER: You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
KRAMER: You've got something between your teeth
KRAMER: You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
KRAMER: You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
KRAMER: You, you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
KRAMER: You? You're getting old.
KRAMER: Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
KRAMER: Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
KRAMER: Youre a human being.
KRAMER: Youre flesh and blood.
KRAMER: Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
KRAMER: Youre not going to wear this.
KRAMER: Youre not going?
KRAMER: Youve never had cantaloupe like this before...
KRAMER: Yowm!
KRAMER: Yowza yowza. Check it out.
KRAMER: Yup! Yup!
KRAMER: Yup, yup!
KRAMER: Yyyeeaaah!!
KRAMER: One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants
KRAMER: Quo? Thats not a word.
KRAMER: What stuff?
KRAMER: ¿Como se dice.. waterbed?
KRAMER: ¿Habla espanol?
KRISTIN: Are you Danny Tartabull?
KRISTIN: Fine. I gotta get back to the office.
KRISTIN: I put a lot of thought into this card.
KRISTIN: Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.
KRISTIN: Jerry, I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull. Where is he?
KRISTIN: Jerry, this man wants to see you.
KRISTIN: Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!
KRISTIN: Okay.
KRISTIN: So where is it?
KRISTIN: The card. Is this it in the trash?
KRISTIN: This is my card, you threw it away.
KRISTIN: You got the card I sent?
KRISTIN: You have no sentimentality.
KRISTIN: You know you guys are both on in five minutes.
KRMAER: Hey.
KRMAER: Man..
KRUGER: ...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.
KRUGER: According to our latest quarterly thing, Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?
KRUGER: Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.
KRUGER: Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.
KRUGER: Ahem. Now, what's your name?
KRUGER: All me.
KRUGER: All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?
KRUGER: Alright, alright I'm going.
KRUGER: Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.
KRUGER: Are you making all this up, too?
KRUGER: But there isn't.
KRUGER: For lunch?
KRUGER: George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.
KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.
KRUGER: George, I got something for you. I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference?
KRUGER: George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.
KRUGER: George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?
KRUGER: George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.
KRUGER: George.
KRUGER: George? Check it out. Three times around, no feet.
KRUGER: Goodnight everybody!
KRUGER: Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?
KRUGER: Hey, Koko, Who's this?
KRUGER: Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?
KRUGER: How about George?
KRUGER: How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?
KRUGER: I don't care. Let's find you an office.
KRUGER: I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.
KRUGER: I find your belief system fascinating.
KRUGER: I'm not too worried about it.
KRUGER: I'm not too worried about it.
KRUGER: It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?
KRUGER: It's K-uger!
KRUGER: K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!
KRUGER: Koko the monkey.
KRUGER: Let's order lunch.
KRUGER: Made out to the Human Fund. Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.
KRUGER: Mary, I will have a chef's salad.
KRUGER: Maybe there should be a Gammy.
KRUGER: Not if you could see our books.. what's this?
KRUGER: Ok, good enough for me, Koko.
KRUGER: So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?
KRUGER: So, how am I looking?
KRUGER: T-bone!
KRUGER: Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me.
KRUGER: They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man.
KRUGER: Vemonous?
KRUGER: Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?
KRUGER: We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.
KRUGER: Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.
KRUGER: Well, then we should call you T-bone.
KRUGER: Whatever.
KRUGER: Who's Gammy?
KRUGER: Works for me. Good thinking, George.
KRUGER: Yeah, you probably should.
KRUGER: You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.
KRUGER: Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?
KURT: Ah, damn.
KURT: Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.
KURT: Elaine... Will you marry me?
KURT: Happy? Why should I be happy?
KURT: Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life.
KURT: Hold it, hold it, hold it, here, I got it. Catch.
KURT: How long do I have?
KURT: I don't care.
KURT: Is there anything I can do?
KURT: It's from yesterday.
KURT: No, no, no...it has to be now.
KURT: Oh my God! I'm going bald!
KURT: Oh yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.
KURT: Oh, God.
KURT: Plus, you want to get to know me.
KURT: They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. And I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I, slugged him.
KURT: Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.
KURT: Well, how much time?
KURT: Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it.
KURT: Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?
KURT: What do you mean?
KURT: What?
KURT: What?
KURT: Who will I be?
KURT: Yeah
KURT: Yeah.
LAB TECHNICIAN: Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a cholesterol work up on it.
LAB TECHNICIAN: No! You know, this is going to take a couple of days.
LAB TECHNICIAN: Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please?LADY 1: Hey! There's that laser guy again.
LADY 1: I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me than looks or hair.
LADY 1: Look! It's on the bald guy.
LADY 1: What is that dot?
LADY 2: He's funny. I never meet anyone funny.
LADY 2: I am so glad we came to this showing.
LADY 2: Mmm, yeah.
LADY 2: Oh, I think someone has one of those funny laser pointers.
LADY: And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month!
LADY: Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22, 000. That's a lot of wheelchairs!
LADY: On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you!
LADY: Roxy! Where have you been? We've been worried sick about you. What's this? Hmm. Rudy's.
LADY: That's right.
LADY: That's right.
LADY: Would you like to buy a rose for your wife?
LAMAR: Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.
LAMAR: Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha ha ha! See ya around!
LAMAR: Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!
LAMAR: Jackass!
LAMAR: Jackass? So I'm a jackass now?
LAMAR: Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab.
LAMAR: Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.
LAMAR: So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.
LAMAR: This traffic's a killer, ain't it?
LAMAR: Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.
LAMAR: What was that?
LAMAR: Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.
LAMAR: You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible. Still haven't.
LANDIS: And you can't acquire grace.
LANDIS: Excuse me?
LANDIS: Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.
LANDIS: He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.
LANDIS: Hello
LANDIS: Hi Cosmo
LANDIS: Hi Mrs. Kramer
LANDIS: How will you get it back?
LANDIS: I tore my umeral epicondilitist
LANDIS: I was watching you play
LANDIS: If I can't play tennis I don't know what I'll do.
LANDIS: If I can't play tennis I have no reason to live ..
LANDIS: Jocylin Landis from Doubleday. I interviewed you for a position a couple of months ago.
LANDIS: Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes.
LANDIS: My doctor said it might never fully heal. I may never play again.
LANDIS: No.
LANDIS: No. You exhibited a lot of grace out there.
LANDIS: Not many people have grace.
LANDIS: Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace.
LANDIS: Thank you for coming in.
LANDIS: That's so generous of you.
LANDIS: We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know.
LANDIS: What am I going to do?
LANDIS: Would you mind if I tried this out?
LANDIS: Yes. So have you found anything yet?
LANDIS: You can't have a little grace. You either have grace, or you...don't.
LANDIS: You don't know how lucky you are to be healthy ...
LANDIS: You know you should keep in touch. Something may be opening up in a few weeks. Is that a Bruline?
LANDLORD: A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing.
LANDLORD: He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.
LANDLORD: Hello?
LANDLORD: I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.
LANDLORD: It's too bad about your father.
LANDLORD: Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?
LANDLORD: Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?
LANDLORD: The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!
LANDLORD: Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs
LANDLORD: Yes, your contention.
LANDLORD: You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.
LANDLORD: Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way.

LAURA: Yea.
LAURA: Yeah, me too.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, hes a great guy...
LAURA: Yeah.

LAURA: You, you really have no idea what its like until you actually do it. And Im on this emotional roller coaster.
LAURA: Youd really like him, you know, I cant wait to get on that boat.
LEADER: Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings.
LEADER: OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous.
LEADER: Please don't call me 'Pinhead'.
LELAND: Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.
LELAND: No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!
LELAND: That's what makes this so difficult.
LELAND: Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.
LENA: A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.
LENA: Guess who volunteered last week?
LENA: He what?
LENA: Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins.
LENA: I don't know.
LENA: I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
LENA: I'll go with you.
LENA: It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
LENA: No, I didn't get the chance.
LENA: No, not at all. No problem.
LENA: No, you said I was a good person...
LENA: No. Maya Angelou.
LENA: Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.
LENA: Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?
LENA: Pardon?
LENA: Talk to who?
LENA: Thanks. So, you were saying...?
LENA: What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.
LENA: Yeah.
LENA: Yeah. That's all they have.
LENA: You seem like you want to tell me something.
LEO: Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
LEO: And you walked out without paying.
LEO: Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
LEO: Arrested? Come on! I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
LEO: Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.

LEO: I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
LEO: I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
LEO: I'll do it.
LEO: I've never seen a band like this.
LEO: If anyone betrays me, I never forget.
LEO: Jerry!
LEO: Jerry! Hello!
LEO: Jerry, hello!
LEO: Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.
LEO: Jerry, will you give me the bottle?
LEO: Jerry, you ratted me out?!
LEO: Jerry.
LEO: Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Answer that damn phone!
LEO: Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
LEO: Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?
LEO: Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.
LEO: No more nuts. Awrghh.....
LEO: Nobody got a gun to your head!
LEO: Oh, they don't care. We all do it.
LEO: Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
LEO: One second...
LEO: Senior citizens. No big deal.
LEO: She's awright.
LEO: The funny thing is: I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me: 'You need any pajamas?'
LEO: They give you some portion here, huh?
LEO: They said they were sending an Asian woman.
LEO: Well, I haven't seen too many like these.
LEO: Well, I hope you send him a check.
LEO: What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
LEO: What fifty dollars?
LEO: What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
LEO: What're you doing here?
LEO: What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
LEO: What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! But I'm not.
LEO: What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
LEO: Where's the bathroom?
LEO: Why didn't ya say hello?
LEO: Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
LEO: Yeah, I hate to give it up.
LEO: Yeah, me too.
LEO: Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
LEO: You have it on you?
LEO: You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
LEO: You know where I got this? I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
LEO: You know where I just came from?
LEO: You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
LEO: You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
LEO: You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
LEO: You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
LEO: You still say hello.
LESLIE: And?
LESLIE: Come on! Let's go!
LESLIE: Elaine, who catered this, Sears?
LESLIE: Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college.
LESLIE: Hi.
LESLIE: I'm going.. obviously.

LESLIE: Oh, I don't give a damn!
LESLIE: Thanks a lot!
LESLIE: Up in Hyannisport.

LESLIE: Yeah?
LESLIE: You bastard!
LESLIE: You ruined me! You ruined my career!
LETTERMAN: Right. Jerry.
LETTERMAN: those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?
LETTERMAN: Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard?
LEVITAN: Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?
LEVITAN: And all the people in this room, that made that possible..
LEVITAN: Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?
LEVITAN: Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.
LEVITAN: Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr Properties.
LEVITAN: Friday.
LEVITAN: God bless you.
LEVITAN: Ha ha, she was great. You don't want to know. Hey Breaky, remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. Get this...I got it all on video.
LEVITAN: Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here!
LEVITAN: Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!
LEVITAN: Hi.
LEVITAN: I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, on Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here?
LEVITAN: I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But, hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this?
LEVITAN: I'd never been to a nudist colony.
LEVITAN: I'll bet you did.
LEVITAN: I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.
LEVITAN: Nah.
LEVITAN: No brains? No ability?
LEVITAN: No.
LEVITAN: Nudist colony?
LEVITAN: Okay. I want you outta here.
LEVITAN: Seriously?
LEVITAN: Who are you?
LEVITAN: Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of business? I, uh, I want you to come back. You can use my bathroom anytime you want.
LEVITAN: Yeah.
LEVITAN: You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.
LEVITAN: You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man.
LEVITAN: You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?
LEVITAN: You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh?
LEVITAN: You're welcome.
LEW: Ah, I knew it was you! You tried to trick Hop Sing! You are onour list; Elaine Benes! And now you are on our list; Ned Isakoff.
LEW: Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list.

LIBRARIAN: It's true.
LIBRARIAN: Just a second.
LIBRARIAN: Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.
LIBRARIAN: Mr. Bookman's not here.
LIBRARIAN: Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.
LIBRARIAN: Yes?
LINDSAY: Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.
LINDSAY: Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?
LINDSAY: Mother...
LINDSAY: Sure.
LIPPMAN: ... as such, it...
LIPPMAN: About coffee tables?
LIPPMAN: Ah, It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!
LIPPMAN: And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel.
LIPPMAN: And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.
LIPPMAN: Boo-eed.
LIPPMAN: Elaine,
LIPPMAN: Get rid of the exclamation points...
LIPPMAN: God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?
LIPPMAN: I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
LIPPMAN: I hate exclamation points...
LIPPMAN: I renounce Judaism!
LIPPMAN: I see, I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out! Exclamation point?
LIPPMAN: I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.
LIPPMAN: It's coming from your purse.
LIPPMAN: It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then, you know, I think I'll have something for you.
LIPPMAN: It's the button at the top, the top.
LIPPMAN: it-it-its her purse.
LIPPMAN: It-no- it's just her sense of humor.
LIPPMAN: Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. Go ahead, count it.
LIPPMAN: No Its Not!!
LIPPMAN: No. e-Elaine.
LIPPMAN: Oh yeah?
LIPPMAN: Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...
LIPPMAN: Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.
LIPPMAN: Oh, no no no. Please.
LIPPMAN: Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.
LIPPMAN: Oh.
LIPPMAN: Really?
LIPPMAN: So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?
LIPPMAN: That's fantastic. Who's your publisher?
LIPPMAN: That's simply not true.
LIPPMAN: The one at the top.
LIPPMAN: Uh huh. Very unusual.
LIPPMAN: Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?
LIPPMAN: Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?
LIPPMAN: We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like.
LIPPMAN: What book?
LIPPMAN: What?
LIPPMAN: What?
LIPPMAN: What?
LIPPMAN: Where... what?
LIPPMAN: Who wants cookies?
LIPPMAN: Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.
LIPPMAN: Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.
LIPPMAN: Yeah? You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?
LIPPMAN: Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
LIPPMAN: Yes.
LIPPMAN: You are wrong. I'll prove it.
LIPPMAN: You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him.
LIPPMAN: You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.
LIPPMAN: You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?
LIPPMAN:..yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? Aw, that's unbelievable. Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! You're from Baltimore, right?
LIPPMAN:Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!
LIPPMAN:But--but he's feeling better now?
LIPPMAN:Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. Can I have my sports section?
LIPPMAN:Good. Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
LIPPMAN:Gotta go.
LIPPMAN:How's your father?
LIPPMAN:I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
LIPPMAN:Right, right. What, what are you doing?
LIPPMAN:Uh-huh.
LIPPMAN:Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?
LIPPMAN:Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.
LIPPMAN:Well, I got a plane to catch.
LIPPMAN:Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?
LIPPMAN:Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.
LIPPMAN:Yeah.
LIPPMAN:Yeah.
LIPPMAN:Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
LIPPMAN:You said boyed.

LLOYD: Anybody see Elaine today?
LLOYD: Buh bye.
LLOYD: Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? Something wrong with your arm?
LLOYD: Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
LLOYD: George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
LLOYD: George.
LLOYD: George?
LLOYD: Got any money?
LLOYD: Gum?
LLOYD: Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
LLOYD: Here y'go.
LLOYD: Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
LLOYD: Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
LLOYD: Hey Kramer.
LLOYD: Hey Kramer.
LLOYD: Hey, George!
LLOYD: Hey, she's a doll.
LLOYD: Hi Elaine.
LLOYD: Hi Jerry.
LLOYD: Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
LLOYD: Hi.
LLOYD: How about that Elaine today, huh?
LLOYD: How you doing?
LLOYD: How'd you like that gum?
LLOYD: I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.
LLOYD: I'd like a hotdog, please.
LLOYD: I'll be back.
LLOYD: I'll run in and get the gum.
LLOYD: Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.
LLOYD: Kramer, maybe...
LLOYD: Maybe I'll mention that to him.
LLOYD: Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.
LLOYD: Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.
LLOYD: Name tags, hmm?
LLOYD: No, it's no problem.
LLOYD: Oh, great. Thanks a lot!
LLOYD: Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.

LLOYD: Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?
LLOYD: Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.
LLOYD: Serenity now. Insanity later.
LLOYD: She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
LLOYD: She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
LLOYD: So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?
LLOYD: So, uh, how's the arm, huh?
LLOYD: So...
LLOYD: Sorry you forgot those glasses.
LLOYD: That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
LLOYD: That's right. Hey, George.
LLOYD: This place does some business, huh?
LLOYD: We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
LLOYD: Well I'm done, should we go?
LLOYD: Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, Hello.
LLOYD: Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. Well, take it easy, huh, George?
LLOYD: Well, if you don't want to...
LLOYD: Well, it was very nice seeing you again.
LLOYD: Well, it's non-fat.
LLOYD: Well, that's great. And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
LLOYD: What do you think put me there?
LLOYD: Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.
LLOYD: Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?
LLOYD: Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
LLOYD: Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.
LLOYD: Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
LLOYD: You alright?
LLOYD: You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.
LLOYD: You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
LLOYD: You sure you don't want any yogurt?
LOIS: . . . Fine.
LOIS: . . . Why did you cheat in that race?
LOIS: About what?
LOIS: Have you designed any buildings in New York?

LOIS: He's okay.
LOIS: Hello.
LOIS: I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you don't race, he's going to fire me.
LOIS: If he beats you I want a big raise.
LOIS: Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry.
LOIS: Race him Jerry. Race him.
LOIS: Really?
LOIS: So you WERE the fastest kid in school.
LOIS: Sorry I missed the Chinese food.
LOIS: What do you do?
LOIS: Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up?
LOIS: Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going to do Jerry?
LOIS: You did that?
LOIS: You really like to say my name? Don't you?
LOIS: You two know each other?
LOIS: You were there?
LOIS:Hi.
LOIS:So will you come to Hawaii with me Jerry?
LOIS:Why don't the two of you just race again?
LORETTA: And I won't take no for an answer.
LORETTA: But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.
LORETTA: George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you.
LORETTA: I want to build something with you, George.
LORETTA: I was in Maine for a couple days.

MACKENZIE: Huh, that's strange. It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?
MACKENZIE: Kind of like a... rustling.
MACKENZIE: Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. Well, take a bite. It's delicious. I insist.
MACKENZIE: No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place.
MACKENZIE: Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.
MACKENZIE: Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, phones ringing, people running in and out. Did you hear something?
MACKENZIE: You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?
MAESTRO: Ah, Kramer.
MAESTRO: Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.
MAESTRO: And I fell in love with this house.
MAESTRO: And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
MAESTRO: Beethoven's 7th.
MAESTRO: Ciao.
MAESTRO: Coincidental.
MAESTRO: Elaine? What a surprise.
MAESTRO: Fine.
MAESTRO: Good question. We'll need a few minutes.
MAESTRO: Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi.
MAESTRO: I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said Hello Maestro, how about a beer. O.K. So that's a fact.
MAESTRO: I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.
MAESTRO: I told you, it's paradise.
MAESTRO: I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.
MAESTRO: I, uh, think I'll get some air.
MAESTRO: It is my very great pleasure.
MAESTRO: It's booked solid!
MAESTRO: It's nothing.
MAESTRO: Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess.
MAESTRO: Nor should you.
MAESTRO: Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.
MAESTRO: Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.
MAESTRO: Oh yeah?
MAESTRO: Oh!
MAESTRO: Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.
MAESTRO: Oh. Love it when that happeneds.
MAESTRO: Ohh, I love this piece.
MAESTRO: Ohh, my pants. It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.
MAESTRO: Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!
MAESTRO: Ohh.. Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..
MAESTRO: The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.
MAESTRO: Unfortunately those photographs are at home.
MAESTRO: Well Hello. And who might you be?
MAESTRO: Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.
MAESTRO: Well, ya know I am a conductor.
MAESTRO: You didn't find one, did you?
MAESTRO: You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
MAESTRO: You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.
MAHJONG LADY: Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!
MAHJONG LADY: So what are you doing now, Georgie?

MAHJONG LADY: You're writing a pilot?
MAID: All done.
MAID: Is this mine?

MAN: The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. I uh only hope you have a little more self-control.

MANDEL: hmmm...interesting take. So you believe, has he not been so enthusiastic he could have adverted disaster.
MANDEL: I think, you've read, one too many, Billy Mumphrey stories. Good day Miss Benes.
MANDEL: So.. It was more a question of attitude than politics..
MANDEL: Three hours of massage time, twelve in-room movies including several adult features, five shoe shines and four hundred dolars worth of snacks. Not to mention the damage to the room.
MANDEL: Unbridled enthusiasm.
MANNY: Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more.
MANNY: Harold, Come on, hurry up!
MANNY: Hello, Jerry. You tell him.
MANNY: It looks worse.
MANNY: Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment.
MANNY: Theyre allowed to play until eleven oclock!
MANNY: What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration.
MANNY: Why are you telling him it's my fault?
MANNY: You can't give him anything from there!
MANNY: You offered them to him.
MANNY: You tell him.
MANYA : Cant dance?
MANYA: He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.
MANYA: I had a pony.
MANYA: Is that a joke?
MANYA: Thats it! I had enough!
MANYA: When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, whats wrong with that?
MANYA: Yeah, yeah..
MANYA: You! You said so!
MANYA: Youre going?
MAR: Hi Jerry.
MARCELINO: 'Kay.
MARCELINO: Can, too!
MARCELINO: Even I am not above the policy.
MARCELINO: Hey, Kramer.
MARCELINO: Jerry! Tomorrow night's fight-night. Where's my rooster?
MARCELINO: Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.
MARCELINO: Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks?
MARCELINO: Nice rooster.
MARCELINO: Now we have a new deal.
MARCELINO: People seem to like the clowns.
MARCELINO: Shhh, not so loud.
MARCELINO: Sorry Kramer, can't help you.
MARCELINO: Sorry, no. It's store policy.
MARCELINO: Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event.
MARCELINO: Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway.
MARCELINO: What's his name?
MARCELINO: When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.
MARCELLINO: Cock fighting.
MARCY: And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill.
MARCY: Are you close with your parents?
MARCY: Bloomingdale's.
MARCY: He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--
MARCY: How'd he look?
MARCY: I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.
MARCY: Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch.
MARCY: Oh, George.
MARCY: Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back.
MARCY: Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store.
MARCY: Okay.
MARCY: So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial.
MARCY: So what's she doing now?
MARCY: Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today.
MARCY: Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that?
MARCY: Why?
MARCY: Yada what?
MARCY: You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease in the hot tub.
MARGARET: Around three. I don't know.
MARGARET: Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?
MARGARET: He ended it.
MARGARET: Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.
MARGARET: Hello.
MARGARET: I liked him.
MARGARET: I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.
MARGARET: I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?
MARGARET: Just a few times.
MARGARET: Kiss me.
MARGARET: Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?
MARGARET: We used to go out.
MARGARET: Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.
MARGARET: What did Kramer say?
MARGARET: Who is staring?

MARION: I'm supposed to be at work. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.
MARION: It's Bookman the library cop.
MARION: Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.
MARISA: ...go introduce myself.
MARISA: ...positrack, which was not available on the sixty-four Buick Skylark.
MARISA: Did you just make that up?
MARISA: Have I told you how much I love you today?
MARISA: No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny.
MARISA: So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken?
MARISA: Well then, c'mon, get dressed. We're going to be late for the premiere.
MARISA: Well, I do love you very much.
MARISA: What?
MARISA: You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. 'Ma' and the 'newer'.
MARK: Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?
MARK: Hey how you doing?
MARK: I don't know, you manufacture it.
MARK: Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: Vandelay Industries.
MARK: Right.
MARK: You're in latex.
MARLA: Alright, then. Good night.
MARLA: Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
MARLA: Are you very fussy about your pants?
MARLA: Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
MARLA: Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
MARLA: Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
MARLA: George. Jerry, Stacey.
MARLA: Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
MARLA: I do. I'm ready.
MARLA: I don't know. He never came back.
MARLA: I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
MARLA: I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
MARLA: I know how difficult this must have been for you.
MARLA: I should be going.
MARLA: I should be going.
MARLA: I'll get some ice.
MARLA: It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
MARLA: Jerry.
MARLA: John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
MARLA: Let me tell you what I think.
MARLA: Let's go in the bedroom.
MARLA: Let's slow it down a little.
MARLA: Maybe I should get going.
MARLA: Never came back.
MARLA: No thanks.
MARLA: No thanks.
MARLA: Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
MARLA: Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!
MARLA: Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
MARLA: So they just leave?
MARLA: So, how was your trip to Berlin?
MARLA: So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
MARLA: The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
MARLA: Well because I'm a virgin.
MARLA: Well because...
MARLA: Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
MARLA: Well I wouldn't move in because...
MARLA: Well what if it was my apartment?
MARLA: Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
MARLA: Well, You know..
MARLA: What do you mean?
MARLA: Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
MARLA: Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
MARLA: Yes.
MARLA: Yes.
MARLA: Yes.
MARLA: You know, the apartment.
MARLA: You're okay with that, right?
MARLA: You, know my boyfriend went.
MARLENE: ...so, it mustve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I dont know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, Marlene, just do it. And I jumped in. And as Im getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.
MARLENE: Are you feeling weird?
MARLENE: Good enough. Im really glad we got that settled.
MARLENE: Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I dont see each other anymore, it doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends.
MARLENE: I cant be with someone if I dont respect what they do.
MARLENE: I heard the material.
MARLENE: I know, Im sorry.
MARLENE: I saw your act.
MARLENE: Im sorry, Jerry. I just dont think this is gonna work.
MARLENE: Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If Im not talking into the soap right now, call me back.
MARLENE: Look, Jerry, its just wasn't my kind of humor.
MARLENE: Nothing really happened.
MARLENE: We just kissed a little. People kiss.
MARLENE: Well, nothing. Its no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didnt see what the big attraction was.
MARLENE: Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.
MARLENE: Well, to be honest, it just didnt make it for me. Its just so much fluff.
MARLENE: Well... night.
MARLENE: You sure you want to talk about this? Cause I sure dont.
MARRY: Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!
MARTIN: Good enough.
MARTIN: Ooooh, ahhhh,
MARTY: Another quilt? Huh?
MARTY: Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes to $17.80.
MARTY: Hey, forget it!
MARTY: I turned my house upside-down looking for this! It's all I have left of her.
MARTY: I'm sorry, it's not ready yet.
MARTY: It's done!
MARTY: Oh, about thirteen dollars.
MARTY: Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself.
MARTY: Well, I'm sorry.
MARTY: Well, see here, the chain is broken...it must have slipped in when I was, uh...
MARTY: Well, uh...maybe tomorrow.
MARTY: What are you talkin' about?
MARTY: Who the hell are you? Huh, It's not your quilt.
MARY ANNE: And I'm still going to be here.
MARY ANNE: George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive.
MARY ANNE: I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?
MARY ANNE: I told you this city would eat you alive.
MARY ANNE: I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from?
MARY ANNE: Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie.
MARY ANNE: Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here.
MARY ANNE: Ooh.
MARY ANNE: Ouch. A month?
MARY ANNE: Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.
MARY ANNE: So I notice you don't have much of an accent.
MARY ANNE: Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.
MARY ANNE: Wow this is your office.
MARY ANNE: Yeah.
MARY ANNE: Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something.
MARY: Hello, Jerry.
MARY: Hi Jeff. How are you?
MARY: Hi Pete. How you doing?
MARY: Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?
MARY: Jerry?! Remember me?
MARY: Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!
MARY: Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and just get out of this building? Nobody wants you here. Nobody!
MARY: Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows.
MARY: Oh, that'd be great.
MARY: Thank you.
MARY: Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.
MARY: You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk to each other.
MARYEDITH: Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes.
MARYEDITH: Come on, Matthew!
MARYEDITH: Come on, Matthew.
MARYEDITH: Every word out of my son's mouth now is *beep*, *beep*, *beep*. You know what he said to me five minutes ago? Where's my *beep*ing cupcake?
MARYEDITH: He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe you could talk to him?
MARYEDITH: Hi!
MARYEDITH: Jerry!
MARYEDITH: Jerry?! What's the matter with you?
MARYEDITH: No *beep*ing way!
MARYEDITH: No, I'm not pregnant.
MARYEDITH: See!
MARYEDITH: Thank you.
MARYEDITH: Well, I hope you're satisfied.
MARYEDITH: What for?
MARYEDITH: What?
MARYEDITH: Yes, I'm sure!
MARYEDITH: You know Jerry.
MATTHEW: All that matters is who was there first.
MATTHEW: Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.
MATTHEW: Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money?
MATTHEW: No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.
MATTHEW: No.
MATTHEW: Of course, he's the funny *beep*.
MATTHEW: Okay.
MATTHEW: Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*.
MATTHEW: We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?
MATTHEW: What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?
MATTHEW: What?!
MATTHEW: You did it.
MATTHEW: You just spit on me!
MATTHEW: You're not my father.
MAURA: Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot.
MAURA: George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner.
MAURA: George, what we have is too important. We can work through this.
MAURA: George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight.
MAURA: George?
MAURA: Hey, Honey.
MAURA: I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like... launching missiles from a submarine. Both of us have to turn our keys.
MAURA: I'm Maura.
MAURA: I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.
MAURA: No, George, we're not.
MAURA: No.
MAURA: No.
MAURA: No.
MAURA: We're not breaking up.
MAURA: You told me to meet you here for lunch.

MIKE: He begged you?!
MIKE: Hey Krame! You know this guy?
MIKE: Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
MIKE: Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
MIKE: Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
MIKE: Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
MIKE: Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
MIKE: Hey, what time you got?
MIKE: Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
MIKE: Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
MIKE: Hey. Jerry.
MIKE: Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide! She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!
MIKE: I can if I have room!
MIKE: I don't know where it is.
MIKE: I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
MIKE: I think I'm parking my car.
MIKE: I was closer to this space than you were.
MIKE: I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
MIKE: I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!
MIKE: I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.

MIKE: What are you asking this guy for?
MIKE: What's the difference?
MIKE: What's up?
MIKE: What? Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.

MILOS: Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...
MILOS: Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it. Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money.

MILOS: Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.
MILOS: Hey everybody, look! The little chicken girl wants me to ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! Hahaha!
MILOS: Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful!
MILOS: Hey, c'mon, what're you doing?
MILOS: I..I...
MILOS: Jerry, for you, anything.
MILOS: Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm, listen...

MILOS: Oh, hey. How you doing?
MILOS: Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here.
MILOS: Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. Wou..would you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man.
MILOS: Shhh-shhh. I make it up to you.
MILOS: Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore.
MINKLER: ...we couldn't say that we said it.
MINKLER: George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, and we think that someone might be you.
MINKLER: No, no.
MINKLER: Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an offer while you're still under contract.
MINKLER: We didn't say that.
MINKLER: We didn't say that.

MISS RHODE ISLAND: Rhode Island.
MOHEL: .. I coulda been a kosher butcher like my brother. The money's good. There's a union, with benefits. And, cows have no families. You make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life... Anyway.
MOHEL: Ah, blood.
MOHEL: Butcher Boy?!
MOHEL: Darling, you see where that glass is? How that glass is near the edge of the table. You got the whole table there to put the glass, why you chose the absolute edge, so half the glass is hanging off the table, you breath and that glass falls over, then you're gonna have broken glass on the carpet, embedded in the carpet fibers, deep, deep in the shag, broken glass, bits of broken glass that you never get out. you can't get it out with a vacuum cleaner. Even on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass, you can't get all the pieces, and then you think you got it all and two years later, you're walkin' barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself, is that what you want? I don't think you want that, is it? .. Do ya? Huh?
MOHEL: Did I find it alright? Could you send me to a more dangerous neighborhood? I'm dreading walking back to the subway, someone shouldn't crack me over the head and steal my bag, Because I'll be lying there and people will spit on me and empty my pockets. I'll be lying in the gutter like a bum, like a dog, like a mutt, like a mongrel, like an animal! God forbid anybody should help me or call an ambulance. Oh no, that's too much trouble to pick up a phone and press a few buttons. Ahh! What's the point.
MOHEL: Hello! Who's holding the baby?!? Who's holding the baby?
MOHEL: Hello, Hello Hello, I'm the Mohel.
MOHEL: I will get you for this. This is my business, this is my life. No one ruins this for me. No one! Here's my card.
MOHEL: It's very nice to meet you all... Oh! What was that?!? Jeez. Scared the hell out of me. My god. I almost had a heart attack! Ok, I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway, we're here to perform the mitzvah of the bris... ...Is the baby gonna cry like that? Is that how the baby cries, with the loud, sustained, squealing cry, 'cause that could pose a problem. Do you have any control of your child 'cause this will be the time to exercise it when baby is crying in that high-pitched, squealing tone that can drive you insane!!!
MOHEL: Okay. you sit here. Now I need the baby. Bring me the baby. I need the baby!
MOHEL: One more peep out of you and I'll slice you up like a smoked sturgeon.
MOHEL: People compose yourselves. This is a bris. We are performing a bris here, not a burlesque show. This is not a school play! This is not a baggy pants farce! This is a bris. An sacred, ancient ceremony, symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham... or something. No! Don't touch it! Don't touch a thing!
MOHEL: Thank god the flincher didn't harm the baby.
MOHEL: The circumcision was perfect. The finger was your fault! You flinched!
MOHEL: What was this?
MOHEL: Ya See! He flinched again!
MOHEL: You're holding the baby?
MOLLIKA: He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.
MOLLIKA: Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.
MOLLIKA: Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy.
MOLLIKA: REally. ... You really look great.
MOLLIKA: What's that?
MOLLY: Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?
MOLLY: Daddy? Are you okay?

MOM: So many sneakers!
MOM: What's the matter?
MONA: I didn't think I'd come.
MONA: Oh, Kramer!
MONA: Pleasure to meet you.
MONA: Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.

MONICA: How did you get there?
MONICA: I need to get something.
MONICA: Is, that the test?
MONICA: Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.
MONICA: Thanks. I hope you do a lot better this time.
MONICA: The door is locked.
MONICA: Time's up George.
MONICA: Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.
MONICA: Well?

MOONEY: We couldn't say that, because even if we did...
MOONEY: We're *not* talking. We're just, talking.
MOONEY: You see what we're saying?
MOONEY: You understand what we're talking about?
MORGAN: Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card?
MORGAN: Fine. I'll be back after my massage.
MORGAN: Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass?
MORGAN: Hello.
MORGAN: I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.
MORGAN: I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off.
MORGAN: I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?
MORGAN: Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.
MORGAN: Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for me to sign.
MORGAN: No sir, George never gave it to me.
MORGAN: Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card?
MORGAN: Why?
MORGAN: Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch.
MORGANEWMAN: I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low.
MORGANEWMAN: Is that right?
MORTY: 19.45$ ?
MORTY: A present?
MORTY: A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
MORTY: Aah! The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
MORTY: Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
MORTY: Ah, good-bye.
MORTY: Ah, he's deaf anyway.
MORTY: Ah, there he is!
MORTY: Aha!
MORTY: Ahh!
MORTY: Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
MORTY: All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . . Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
MORTY: All right, all right.
MORTY: All right, Leo.
MORTY: All right. Make it 20 bucks.
MORTY: All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
MORTY: Alright alright, goodbye. I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
MORTY: Alright Jer.
MORTY: Alright, are you ready to eat?
MORTY: Alright, Leo.
MORTY: Alright, let's get going.
MORTY: Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
MORTY: And every morning I eat a plum.
MORTY: And its always about Jeffrey, right?
MORTY: And smart! Like a computer!
MORTY: And we want you to have the money.
MORTY: Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
MORTY: Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
MORTY: Are you getting that?
MORTY: Are you kidding? They built the lake.
MORTY: Are you ready for dessert?
MORTY: Astronaut?
MORTY: Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
MORTY: Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
MORTY: Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
MORTY: Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
MORTY: Because I have the votes.
MORTY: Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
MORTY: Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
MORTY: because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
MORTY: Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
MORTY: Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
MORTY: Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
MORTY: Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
MORTY: Boy that was some show.
MORTY: Boy, you are really something.
MORTY: Bring me the receipt.
MORTY: Buh bye Elaine
MORTY: But it comes on 11:30.
MORTY: But there are no stamps on these.
MORTY: By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
MORTY: Bye bye. Thanks again for the wallet.
MORTY: Bye, Jer.
MORTY: Bye, Mr. Kramer.
MORTY: C'mon, take a ride.
MORTY: Call an ambulance.
MORTY: Can you believe this?!
MORTY: Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
MORTY: Come on. That's enough, sit down!
MORTY: Congratulations, Mr. President.
MORTY: Could you believe that guy?
MORTY: D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
MORTY: Daily what?
MORTY: Depends on the firm.
MORTY: Did you have a coke or what?
MORTY: Did you send them?
MORTY: Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
MORTY: Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
MORTY: Don't lie Jerry.
MORTY: Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
MORTY: Don't tell your mother.
MORTY: Don't worry about it.
MORTY: Don't worry about it.
MORTY: Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. I can't get it open.
MORTY: Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
MORTY: Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
MORTY: First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
MORTY: First, I need a nap.
MORTY: From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
MORTY: George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
MORTY: Get out of here.
MORTY: Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
MORTY: Good evening, Mr. Kramer!
MORTY: Good. O.K. What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
MORTY: Got lucky.
MORTY: HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
MORTY: He could wash them.
MORTY: He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
MORTY: He gave him the pen.
MORTY: He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
MORTY: He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
MORTY: He pretends he bumped into her!
MORTY: He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
MORTY: He'll send them express.
MORTY: He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
MORTY: He's wearing one.
MORTY: Heh hah!
MORTY: Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
MORTY: Helen, did you pack my travel gym?
MORTY: Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
MORTY: Helen, will you stop bothering him.
MORTY: Hello
MORTY: Hello Elaine
MORTY: Hello Elaine
MORTY: Hello Jack.
MORTY: Hello Jack.
MORTY: Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
MORTY: Hello.
MORTY: Hello.
MORTY: Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.
MORTY: Hello?
MORTY: Here, I got it.
MORTY: Hey give 'em our best though.
MORTY: Hey guys . Jerry . Kramer
MORTY: Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
MORTY: Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
MORTY: Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
MORTY: Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
MORTY: Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
MORTY: Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look, Macadamian nuts.
MORTY: Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
MORTY: Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
MORTY: Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
MORTY: Hey, George!
MORTY: Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?
MORTY: Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
MORTY: Hey, Jerry.
MORTY: Hey, Mr. Kramer!
MORTY: Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.
MORTY: Hey, thats some big job.
MORTY: Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
MORTY: Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
MORTY: His pen.
MORTY: Hiya Kramer.
MORTY: Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. Watch this.
MORTY: How about Loni Anderson?
MORTY: How come he gets to leave?
MORTY: How could you not get the insurance?
MORTY: How long they been doing this?
MORTY: How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
MORTY: How the hell do you work this thing?
MORTY: How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
MORTY: How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
MORTY: How're your folks?
MORTY: I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
MORTY: I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
MORTY: I could have danced all night I could have danced all night and still have
MORTY: I did so thank him!
MORTY: I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
MORTY: I don't see envelopes!
MORTY: I don't think we even use it.
MORTY: I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
MORTY: I don't want it!
MORTY: I dont know her either. She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
MORTY: I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
MORTY: I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
MORTY: I got my sport jacket.
MORTY: I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
MORTY: I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
MORTY: I knew it, I told you!
MORTY: I retract your retraction.
MORTY: I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
MORTY: I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
MORTY: I tell you, he bought it for me!
MORTY: I thought you forgot about me.
MORTY: I told you to send them express.
MORTY: I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
MORTY: I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
MORTY: I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
MORTY: I was never impeached! I resigned!
MORTY: I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
MORTY: I'd have to go back to work.
MORTY: I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
MORTY: I'll get a book.
MORTY: I'll make a few phone calls.
MORTY: I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
MORTY: I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
MORTY: I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
MORTY: I'm gonna explain what boxes.
MORTY: I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
MORTY: I'm not talking loud!
MORTY: I'm paying.
MORTY: I'm ready
MORTY: I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
MORTY: I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
MORTY: I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
MORTY: I'm thinking more like fifteen.
MORTY: I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
MORTY: If anything you're getting too much.
MORTY: If they get the votes.
MORTY: It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
MORTY: It's mine.
MORTY: It's Morty
MORTY: It's too much car, Jerry.
MORTY: It's velcro.
MORTY: Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
MORTY: Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
MORTY: Ill get it!
MORTY: Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
MORTY: Jack have some spong cake.
MORTY: Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
MORTY: Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
MORTY: Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
MORTY: Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
MORTY: Jerry!
MORTY: Jerry!
MORTY: Jerry's a comedian.
MORTY: Jerry, don't go.
MORTY: Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
MORTY: Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
MORTY: Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
MORTY: Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
MORTY: Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?
MORTY: Jerry, you ever watch that?
MORTY: Just a second.
MORTY: Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
MORTY: Just watch me do my thing.
MORTY: Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
MORTY: Leave all my stuff here?
MORTY: Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
MORTY: Leo, let's go.
MORTY: Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
MORTY: Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
MORTY: Look at this! Look at this! You bought a Cadillac?!
MORTY: Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. My back was fine.
MORTY: Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. Kramer you missed a couple.
MORTY: Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
MORTY: Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
MORTY: Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
MORTY: Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
MORTY: Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
MORTY: Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
MORTY: Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
MORTY: Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
MORTY: Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
MORTY: Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
MORTY: Maybe you should see a doctor.
MORTY: Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
MORTY: My Fair Lady
MORTY: My idiot son could open that garage door.
MORTY: My son bought me that car!
MORTY: My son bought me the car. It's a present.
MORTY: My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
MORTY: Nervous, Jack?
MORTY: Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.
MORTY: No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
MORTY: No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
MORTY: No, no put it away . . .
MORTY: No, no, he won't let me do that.
MORTY: No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie.
MORTY: No, we just came for the funeral. `
MORTY: No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
MORTY: No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
MORTY: Nobody uses it.
MORTY: None
MORTY: Not really.
MORTY: Nothing nothing.
MORTY: Nothing. Batteries. Well, they wear out so quick.
MORTY: Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
MORTY: Number One, signing off.
MORTY: Oh come on!
MORTY: Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
MORTY: Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
MORTY: Oh! I forgot all about it.
MORTY: Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
MORTY: Oh, for Gods sake!
MORTY: Oh, it's George.
MORTY: Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
MORTY: Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
MORTY: Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.
MORTY: Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
MORTY: Ok it's a deal
MORTY: Ok, bye.
MORTY: Ok, let's go.
MORTY: Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
MORTY: Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
MORTY: Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
MORTY: Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
MORTY: Outside? What's going on?
MORTY: Pinko Commie rag.
MORTY: Plum...
MORTY: Plus the insurance.
MORTY: President?
MORTY: Quones not a word.
MORTY: Raincoats.
MORTY: Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
MORTY: Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
MORTY: See that? You couldn't do that.
MORTY: See what I'm wearing?
MORTY: Send them tomorrow.
MORTY: She's got priors.
MORTY: Should I pick up?
MORTY: Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
MORTY: Slept on the job?
MORTY: So ask Elaine there for her number.
MORTY: So bring a snack-pack.
MORTY: So look.
MORTY: So much the better.
MORTY: So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
MORTY: So what did you do about the window?
MORTY: So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
MORTY: So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
MORTY: So, how d'you like this?
MORTY: So, how did she find out?
MORTY: So, howd you do?
MORTY: So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
MORTY: So, what are you? Afraid of her?
MORTY: So, what took you so long?
MORTY: So, when do I get to see the doctor?
MORTY: So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
MORTY: Somebody had a coke.
MORTY: Sorbonne? Oh, hey. That's in Paris.
MORTY: Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
MORTY: Stealing?!
MORTY: Stop it.
MORTY: Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
MORTY: Tell him to eat a plum.
MORTY: Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that!
MORTY: Tell your parents we said 'Hi!'
MORTY: That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
MORTY: That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
MORTY: That's a good idea.
MORTY: That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
MORTY: That's right, they're my coats.
MORTY: That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
MORTY: That's right. My son bought it for me.
MORTY: That's right. They went like hotcakes.
MORTY: That's terrific!
MORTY: That's the second time you said personal favor. Why do you keep saying that?
MORTY: That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
MORTY: That's what you say.
MORTY: The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
MORTY: The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
MORTY: The whole movie was in black and white.
MORTY: Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
MORTY: There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
MORTY: There she is.
MORTY: There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
MORTY: They give you that *Fish.*
MORTY: They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
MORTY: They stole my wallet.
MORTY: They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
MORTY: They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.
MORTY: They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
MORTY: They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
MORTY: This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
MORTY: This is it.
MORTY: This is my son Jerry, from New York. He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
MORTY: This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
MORTY: This is some office. What's the square footage?
MORTY: This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
MORTY: This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.
MORTY: This looks like too much money.
MORTY: This shirt will never leave my body.
MORTY: This was a gift from my son.
MORTY: Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
MORTY: Thousands?!
MORTY: Tomorrow afternoon?
MORTY: Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
MORTY: Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
MORTY: Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
MORTY: Uh huh.
MORTY: Uh we'll drive around for a while.
MORTY: We can't stand them.
MORTY: We got plenty of time.
MORTY: We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
MORTY: We'll round down.
MORTY: We'll see.
MORTY: We'll take a bus.
MORTY: We're going with a select charter group.
MORTY: We're keeping it.
MORTY: Welcome to Florida!
MORTY: Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
MORTY: Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
MORTY: Well we do.
MORTY: Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
MORTY: Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
MORTY: Well you're not getting thirty-five.
MORTY: Well, go up to the office.
MORTY: Well, he's not getting away with this!
MORTY: Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
MORTY: Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
MORTY: Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
MORTY: Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
MORTY: Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
MORTY: Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
MORTY: Well, we just bought a new place down there.
MORTY: What about her?
MORTY: What about the end, with the list?
MORTY: What are you kidding me?
MORTY: What are you talking about?
MORTY: What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
MORTY: What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
MORTY: What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
MORTY: What are you talking? We use it.
MORTY: What are you worried about?
MORTY: What are you, nuts?
MORTY: What did you have? You had the minute steak?
MORTY: What did you say?
MORTY: What do you mean?
MORTY: What do you want?
MORTY: What for?
MORTY: What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
MORTY: What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
MORTY: What leg work?
MORTY: What nervous?
MORTY: What the hell are you doing here?
MORTY: What the hell are you looking for?
MORTY: What the hell is going on here?
MORTY: What was that?
MORTY: What was that?
MORTY: What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
MORTY: What're you talking about?
MORTY: What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
MORTY: What's all that?
MORTY: What's not to understand?
MORTY: What's the difference, we'll figure something out.
MORTY: What'ya got leather seats here?
MORTY: What?
MORTY: What?
MORTY: What?
MORTY: What?
MORTY: What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
MORTY: Whats the matter? You need a lawyer?
MORTY: Whats wrong with it?
MORTY: When are we gonna tell Jerry?
MORTY: Where do you come off with this crap?
MORTY: Who are they?
MORTY: Who are you?
MORTY: Who is it?
MORTY: Who needs this?
MORTY: Who's Mr Fancy?
MORTY: Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
MORTY: Who's that?
MORTY: Why are you whispering?
MORTY: Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
MORTY: Why is that?
MORTY: Why not?
MORTY: Why should I be comfortable?
MORTY: Why the hell didn't you tell us?
MORTY: Why would he mind? We're his parents.
MORTY: Why, whats wrong with Loni Anderson?
MORTY: Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
MORTY: Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
MORTY: Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
MORTY: Ya so have I
MORTY: Yea
MORTY: yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
MORTY: Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
MORTY: Yeah, so?

MORTY: Yeah, yeah, you make money.
MORTY: Yeah.
MORTY: Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
MORTY: Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
MORTY: Yes, I do!
MORTY: Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
MORTY: You believe this?

MORTY: You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
MORTY: You know that number?

MORTY: You're a terrific kid.
MORTY: You're out of your mind.
MORTY: You're packing cereal?
MORTY: Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
MORTY: Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
MORTY: Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
MOTHER: Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?
MOTHER: Donald, you used to like him.

NARRATOR: It's a story about life. And love. And becoming a woman. ``Rochelle Rochelle'', now playing at Paradise 2.
NARRATOR: The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece. A young woman's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
NED: All right, I'll try it on.
NED: Anyone who works here is a sap.
NED: Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive.
NED: I bet the beard itches doesn't it?
NED: I guess.
NED: I know it's not the same.
NED: I'm sorry Elaine. The shirt's too fancy.
NED: Kramer, I've got some literature in my car that will change your whole way of thinking.
NED: Out of the question.
NED: So when you get a rash all over your face in January do you think Coleman's will be there with a medical plan?
NED: Yeah, we had a good run.
NED: Yeah, well, we still got China, and Cuba,
NED: Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They named names.
NED: Yes, as a matter of fact I am.
NED: You got me blacklisted from Hop Sing's?
NED: You understand the Santa's at Bloomfields are making double what you are?
NED: You're ordering from Hop Sing's, right?
NEIGHBOR: Alright, that's it!
NEIGHBOR: Hey, get the hell out of here!
NEIGHBOR: Oh, oh mama...
NEIGHBOR: Turn it off! Turn it off!
NEIL: George.
NEIL: I win.

NEPHEW: I cant. Ill get in trouble.
NEPHEW: Im not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. Im just an intern. I cant write a note to an airline.
NEWMAN AND KRAMER: Ohhh!
NEWMAN AND KRAMER: Sucker..
NEWMAN: ...Aargh!
NEWMAN: ...But I have made a decision. We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
NEWMAN: ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
NEWMAN: ???????
NEWMAN: A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
NEWMAN: A pie stand? Where?
NEWMAN: A piece of crap.
NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
NEWMAN: Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
NEWMAN: Aaah!! Aaah!
NEWMAN: Aahh! You're great, It's great, It's so great to see a show that's about something.
NEWMAN: After you.
NEWMAN: Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
NEWMAN: Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
NEWMAN: Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
NEWMAN: Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
NEWMAN: Ahaha!
NEWMAN: Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
NEWMAN: Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
NEWMAN: All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
NEWMAN: All right give it to me. let go ...
NEWMAN: All right! All right. I wont say anything.
NEWMAN: All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
NEWMAN: All right, all right.
NEWMAN: All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
NEWMAN: All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
NEWMAN: All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
NEWMAN: All right, give me the rope.
NEWMAN: All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
NEWMAN: All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
NEWMAN: All right, so it's me. So what?
NEWMAN: All right, tell it.
NEWMAN: All right. Bark.
NEWMAN: All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
NEWMAN: All right. See you later.
NEWMAN: All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
NEWMAN: Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a lot of Elaine.
NEWMAN: Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
NEWMAN: Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
NEWMAN: Alright, let's begin.
NEWMAN: Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
NEWMAN: Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
NEWMAN: Alright, well be back... *jack*!
NEWMAN: Alright, who's first?
NEWMAN: Alright.
NEWMAN: Alright. Come back to my party, please.
NEWMAN: An alliance?
NEWMAN: And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
NEWMAN: And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
NEWMAN: And then you spit on us.
NEWMAN: And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
NEWMAN: And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
NEWMAN: And why was that?
NEWMAN: And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
NEWMAN: And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
NEWMAN: Anything else?
NEWMAN: Anyway.
NEWMAN: Are you crazy?
NEWMAN: Are you married right now?
NEWMAN: Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
NEWMAN: As a matter of fact, I did.
NEWMAN: As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
NEWMAN: Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
NEWMAN: Aww..
NEWMAN: Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas
NEWMAN: Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
NEWMAN: Bark.
NEWMAN: Beauty .. and brains.
NEWMAN: Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
NEWMAN: Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got.
NEWMAN: Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
NEWMAN: Blast!
NEWMAN: Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! The dream is dead.
NEWMAN: Boy, thats the full size.
NEWMAN: Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
NEWMAN: But it's your house.
NEWMAN: But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
NEWMAN: But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
NEWMAN: But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
NEWMAN: But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
NEWMAN: Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
NEWMAN: Butter?
NEWMAN: Can I have a bite?
NEWMAN: Can I have a sip?
NEWMAN: Can I have some gravy?
NEWMAN: Can I try it on?
NEWMAN: Can I use your bathroom?
NEWMAN: Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
NEWMAN: Can't we worry about them later?
NEWMAN: Cancel! Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
NEWMAN: Care for some lemonade?
NEWMAN: Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
NEWMAN: Come on Kramer!
NEWMAN: Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
NEWMAN: Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
NEWMAN: Come on, let me try it on.
NEWMAN: Cool?
NEWMAN: Coy? I'm not being coy.
NEWMAN: Crazy Joe Davola?
NEWMAN: Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
NEWMAN: Damn!
NEWMAN: Damn!
NEWMAN: Damn!
NEWMAN: Deh!
NEWMAN: Did I?
NEWMAN: Do I smell Pantene?
NEWMAN: Do not bend. Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well.
NEWMAN: Do we have a deal?
NEWMAN: Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
NEWMAN: Does yours?
NEWMAN: Don't despair, my friend. I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
NEWMAN: Don't look at me.
NEWMAN: Don't say anything.
NEWMAN: Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
NEWMAN: Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
NEWMAN: El Paso!
NEWMAN: Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
NEWMAN: eue-aaa.
NEWMAN: Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
NEWMAN: Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform.
NEWMAN: Excellent. Excellent.
NEWMAN: Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
NEWMAN: Federal employee. Federal employee.
NEWMAN: Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.
NEWMAN: Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I, give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
NEWMAN: For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
NEWMAN: Fourty-nine.
NEWMAN: Frequently.
NEWMAN: From me!
NEWMAN: Gangway!
NEWMAN: Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
NEWMAN: George?
NEWMAN: Go girl!
NEWMAN: Go on.
NEWMAN: Good night.
NEWMAN: Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel
NEWMAN: Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
NEWMAN: ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
NEWMAN: He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
NEWMAN: He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
NEWMAN: He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
NEWMAN: He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
NEWMAN: He's out.
NEWMAN: He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
NEWMAN: Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
NEWMAN: Hello Elaine. Where are they?
NEWMAN: Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry, may I come in?
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. So, any news?
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
NEWMAN: Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
NEWMAN: Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry.
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
NEWMAN: Hello. What 's this?
NEWMAN: Hello?
NEWMAN: Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
NEWMAN: HELP!
NEWMAN: Help! Help!
NEWMAN: Here.
NEWMAN: Here. Hold this.
NEWMAN: Hey George, nice hat.
NEWMAN: Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! Ha, ha, ha.
NEWMAN: Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
NEWMAN: Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
NEWMAN: Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
NEWMAN: Hey!! Help me!
NEWMAN: Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
NEWMAN: Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
NEWMAN: Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
NEWMAN: Hey, hey, hey. I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
NEWMAN: Hey, hey...
NEWMAN: Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
NEWMAN: Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
NEWMAN: Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
NEWMAN: Hey, what is that up that tree?
NEWMAN: Hey, what's up?
NEWMAN: Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
NEWMAN: Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
NEWMAN: Hi Babs
NEWMAN: Hilarious.
NEWMAN: Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
NEWMAN: Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
NEWMAN: How much gas we got?
NEWMAN: How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
NEWMAN: Huh.
NEWMAN: I *loathe* you.
NEWMAN: I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
NEWMAN: I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
NEWMAN: I can't afford that!
NEWMAN: I can't believe I'm being evicted.
NEWMAN: I can't eat this.
NEWMAN: I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
NEWMAN: I can't think, there's all this noise.
NEWMAN: I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.
NEWMAN: I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
NEWMAN: I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
NEWMAN: I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
NEWMAN: I despise him.
NEWMAN: I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
NEWMAN: I didn't get my transfer.
NEWMAN: I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
NEWMAN: I don't have that kinda dough.
NEWMAN: I don't know, they're deranged.
NEWMAN: I don't like it.
NEWMAN: I don't see any pie...
NEWMAN: I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
NEWMAN: I don't wanna.
NEWMAN: I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
NEWMAN: I find you extremely ugly.
NEWMAN: I guess there's not much action down there these days.
NEWMAN: I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
NEWMAN: I guess.
NEWMAN: I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
NEWMAN: I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
NEWMAN: I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
NEWMAN: I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. If you don't mind?
NEWMAN: I have done nothing unethical.
NEWMAN: I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
NEWMAN: I hope you know what you're doing...
NEWMAN: I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
NEWMAN: I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
NEWMAN: I knew you'd back out.
NEWMAN: I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
NEWMAN: I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
NEWMAN: I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
NEWMAN: I like the thick tape.
NEWMAN: I need that mail, where is it?!
NEWMAN: I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
NEWMAN: I shoulda gone in with him.
NEWMAN: I swear.
NEWMAN: I think he stealing our rickshaw!
NEWMAN: I told you he was a risk.
NEWMAN: I too am well.
NEWMAN: I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
NEWMAN: I use dental tape.
NEWMAN: I usually do. See ya.
NEWMAN: I wanna learn. I want to know why.
NEWMAN: I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
NEWMAN: I wanted to, he won't let me.
NEWMAN: I was never that big on creeds.
NEWMAN: I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
NEWMAN: I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
NEWMAN: I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
NEWMAN: I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
NEWMAN: I'm a United States postal worker.
NEWMAN: I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
NEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut.
NEWMAN: I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
NEWMAN: I'm on the roof!
NEWMAN: I'm sorry I missed that.
NEWMAN: I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
NEWMAN: If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
NEWMAN: If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
NEWMAN: If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
NEWMAN: Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
NEWMAN: Is that Jerry's number?
NEWMAN: Is this or is this not your signature?
NEWMAN: It gets my rug clean.
NEWMAN: It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
NEWMAN: It was a cinch. Where are you going?
NEWMAN: It was a real melee.
NEWMAN: It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
NEWMAN: It was disgusting.
NEWMAN: It was McDowell.
NEWMAN: It was your family that pushed you into banking, it was their dream for you...
NEWMAN: It'll be my pleasure.
NEWMAN: It's about...Elaine.
NEWMAN: It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
NEWMAN: It's entirely possible.
NEWMAN: It's gorgeous water. Do we own Bermuda?
NEWMAN: It's Newman.
NEWMAN: It's Newman.
NEWMAN: It's okay. A little crooked.
NEWMAN: It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
NEWMAN: It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
NEWMAN: It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
NEWMAN: It's Thursday.
NEWMAN: Ill bring him up to date.
NEWMAN: Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
NEWMAN: Jerry!
NEWMAN: Jerry! Jerry!
NEWMAN: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
NEWMAN: Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry?
NEWMAN: Jerry, George. So, did you ask him about the records?
NEWMAN: Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
NEWMAN: Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
NEWMAN: Jerry?
NEWMAN: Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
NEWMAN: June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
NEWMAN: June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
NEWMAN: Just one bite?
NEWMAN: Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
NEWMAN: KEITH HERNANDEZ?
NEWMAN: Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
NEWMAN: Kramer bit me!
NEWMAN: Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
NEWMAN: Kramer!
NEWMAN: Kramer! I'm with people.
NEWMAN: Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.
NEWMAN: Kramer!!
NEWMAN: Kramer!!
NEWMAN: Kramer, help me! Help me!
NEWMAN: Kramer, what the hell are you doing?
NEWMAN: Kramer.
NEWMAN: Kramer.
NEWMAN: Kramer? Kramer? There you are.
NEWMAN: Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
NEWMAN: Let the collecting begin!
NEWMAN: Let's go. Let's go. Move!
NEWMAN: Like Silkwood.
NEWMAN: Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
NEWMAN: Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
NEWMAN: Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
NEWMAN: Lucky krauts.
NEWMAN: Make us!
NEWMAN: Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
NEWMAN: Me either.
NEWMAN: Me too.
NEWMAN: Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
NEWMAN: Minding my own business.
NEWMAN: Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
NEWMAN: Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
NEWMAN: Mouth-to-mouth?
NEWMAN: My toilet's clogged.
NEWMAN: Nah.
NEWMAN: Name, please.
NEWMAN: Never.
NEWMAN: Nevertheless, ...
NEWMAN: Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
NEWMAN: No reason.
NEWMAN: No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
NEWMAN: No! And no one will ever see you again!
NEWMAN: No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
NEWMAN: No, no I don't like it.
NEWMAN: No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
NEWMAN: No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
NEWMAN: No, no. I love strong cider. I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
NEWMAN: No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
NEWMAN: No, you can't tell it ..
NEWMAN: No.
NEWMAN: No.
NEWMAN: No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
NEWMAN: No. Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
NEWMAN: No. No.
NEWMAN: Not for a while.
NEWMAN: Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
NEWMAN: Not really.
NEWMAN: Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
NEWMAN: Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
NEWMAN: Not that!
NEWMAN: Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
NEWMAN: Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
NEWMAN: Of course. Obviously.
NEWMAN: Of course. Take your time. I be here.
NEWMAN: Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata
NEWMAN: Oh no, no, not the bag!
NEWMAN: Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
NEWMAN: Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
NEWMAN: Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
NEWMAN: Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
NEWMAN: Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
NEWMAN: Oh, all the way up.
NEWMAN: Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
NEWMAN: Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
NEWMAN: Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane observations?
NEWMAN: Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
NEWMAN: Oh, thank you, sir.
NEWMAN: Oh, that's real.
NEWMAN: Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
NEWMAN: Oh, yeah, right.
NEWMAN: Ohh, were you there?
NEWMAN: Okay, here it is.
NEWMAN: Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
NEWMAN: Okay.
NEWMAN: Okay. What is it?
NEWMAN: Olly, olly, oxen, free!
NEWMAN: On my mothers life.
NEWMAN: On what?
NEWMAN: Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
NEWMAN: One large jambalaya, please.
NEWMAN: One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
NEWMAN: Ooh, my cocoa!
NEWMAN: Oooh,
NEWMAN: Pair of bear claws please.
NEWMAN: Pair of bear claws, please.
NEWMAN: Pam. I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
NEWMAN: Pantene!
NEWMAN: Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
NEWMAN: Quick! Get in!
NEWMAN: Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
NEWMAN: Refund?
NEWMAN: Right.
NEWMAN: Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
NEWMAN: Rusty.
NEWMAN: See'ya later.
NEWMAN: Shell.
NEWMAN: Shocking.
NEWMAN: So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
NEWMAN: So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
NEWMAN: So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
NEWMAN: So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
NEWMAN: So, which one of us is gonna pull?
NEWMAN: So, you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
NEWMAN: Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
NEWMAN: Sometimes we don't get what we want.
NEWMAN: Sometimes...
NEWMAN: Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
NEWMAN: Sorry, last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
NEWMAN: Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
NEWMAN: Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
NEWMAN: South America?! What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
NEWMAN: Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
NEWMAN: Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
NEWMAN: Take me! Take me!
NEWMAN: Tell the world my story.
NEWMAN: Ten cents!?
NEWMAN: Thank you. Jambalaya!
NEWMAN: Thanks buddy. So long he he ...
NEWMAN: That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
NEWMAN: That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
NEWMAN: That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
NEWMAN: That smell. It's still with you, huh?
NEWMAN: That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
NEWMAN: That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
NEWMAN: That's right.
NEWMAN: That's where my missing soda is.
NEWMAN: The airport?
NEWMAN: The bank. What about your cards and letters?
NEWMAN: The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
NEWMAN: The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
NEWMAN: The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
NEWMAN: The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
NEWMAN: The Pacific Northwest.
NEWMAN: The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
NEWMAN: There it is!
NEWMAN: There will be a small fine.
NEWMAN: There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
NEWMAN: There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
NEWMAN: They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
NEWMAN: They follow him like a cult.
NEWMAN: They're gonna beat me up!
NEWMAN: This isn't about my opening your mail?
NEWMAN: This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
NEWMAN: This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
NEWMAN: Those records are worth more than five dollars!
NEWMAN: Tim Whatley.
NEWMAN: To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
NEWMAN: To prevent an ambush.
NEWMAN: To the Newmanniun!
NEWMAN: Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
NEWMAN: Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
NEWMAN: Turkey?
NEWMAN: Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
NEWMAN: Uh ah Having a nice trip?
NEWMAN: Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
NEWMAN: Uh..
NEWMAN: Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
NEWMAN: Waaaaahhhh!
NEWMAN: Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
NEWMAN: Wallet.
NEWMAN: We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
NEWMAN: We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?
NEWMAN: We got no one!
NEWMAN: We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
NEWMAN: We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
NEWMAN: We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
NEWMAN: We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
NEWMAN: We made quite a haul.
NEWMAN: We'll pay anything. We've got the What about Jerry?
NEWMAN: We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
NEWMAN: We're practically to Monticello.
NEWMAN: Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
NEWMAN: Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
NEWMAN: Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
NEWMAN: Well my girlfriend had one.
NEWMAN: Well sure it would.
NEWMAN: Well that's a shame.
NEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.
NEWMAN: Well you're reneging.
NEWMAN: Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
NEWMAN: Well, Elaine, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
NEWMAN: Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
NEWMAN: Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
NEWMAN: Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
NEWMAN: Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, Nice try, granny! And I sent her to the back of the line!
NEWMAN: Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
NEWMAN: Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
NEWMAN: Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
NEWMAN: Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
NEWMAN: Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
NEWMAN: Well, ta-ta!
NEWMAN: Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
NEWMAN: Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
NEWMAN: Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
NEWMAN: Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
NEWMAN: Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
NEWMAN: Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
NEWMAN: What about a guest-host?
NEWMAN: What about your bills?
NEWMAN: What are you doing?
NEWMAN: What are you doing?
NEWMAN: What are you proposing?
NEWMAN: What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
NEWMAN: What do you think? Drive. Drive.
NEWMAN: What for, you got your own.
NEWMAN: What for?
NEWMAN: What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
NEWMAN: What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
NEWMAN: What kind of dog did you say it was?
NEWMAN: What kind?
NEWMAN: What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
NEWMAN: What the hell was that?
NEWMAN: What took you so long?
NEWMAN: What you need me in the car for?
NEWMAN: What're you doing?
NEWMAN: What're you doing?
NEWMAN: What're you talking about...
NEWMAN: What's the catch?
NEWMAN: What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
NEWMAN: What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
NEWMAN: What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
NEWMAN: When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
NEWMAN: Where? I..I..I don't see it.
NEWMAN: Who is it.
NEWMAN: Who made you the leader?
NEWMAN: Who's talking to you?
NEWMAN: Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
NEWMAN: Why, because I use dental tape?
NEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...
NEWMAN: Will that take care of ours too?
NEWMAN: With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast.
NEWMAN: Work? It's raining.
NEWMAN: Wow, it was McDowell.
NEWMAN: Wow, where did you get that?
NEWMAN: Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
NEWMAN: Yeah, but he's a fighter.
NEWMAN: Yeah, but I though-
NEWMAN: Yeah, but you pulled him in.
NEWMAN: Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
NEWMAN: Yeah, I suppose.
NEWMAN: Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
NEWMAN: Yeah, me too.
NEWMAN: Yeah, tell me about it.
NEWMAN: Yeah, yeah.
NEWMAN: Yeah.
NEWMAN: Yeah.
NEWMAN: Yeah. From you.
NEWMAN: Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
NEWMAN: Yeah. Maybe.
NEWMAN: Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
NEWMAN: Yep.
NEWMAN: Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
NEWMAN: Yes thank you.
NEWMAN: Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
NEWMAN: Yes, a phone call!
NEWMAN: Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
NEWMAN: Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
NEWMAN: Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. Help me Kramer! Help me!
NEWMAN: Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
NEWMAN: Yes, the banker!!!
NEWMAN: Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
NEWMAN: Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...
NEWMAN: Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
NEWMAN: Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.
NEWMAN: Yessss!
NEWMAN: You are nothing but a piece of crap.
NEWMAN: You are?
NEWMAN: You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
NEWMAN: You certainly are in a bind.
NEWMAN: You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
NEWMAN: You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
NEWMAN: You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
NEWMAN: You go.
NEWMAN: You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
NEWMAN: You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
NEWMAN: You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
NEWMAN: You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
NEWMAN: You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
NEWMAN: You know what I mean.
NEWMAN: You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
NEWMAN: You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, Why? Are we really so different. For what is--
NEWMAN: You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course.
NEWMAN: You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
NEWMAN: You lookin' for someone?
NEWMAN: You might say that.
NEWMAN: You must be banker.
NEWMAN: You must!
NEWMAN: You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
NEWMAN: You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
NEWMAN: You shut up! I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
NEWMAN: You tried it?
NEWMAN: You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
NEWMAN: You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
NEWMAN: You were going to...
NEWMAN: You will!
NEWMAN: You're gyppin' us!
NEWMAN: You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen: you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
NEWMAN: You're off your rocker.
NEWMAN: You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
NEWMAN: You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
NEWMAN: You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
NEWMAN: You?! You can't deliver mail!
NEWMAN: Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
NEWMAN: Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.
NEWMAN: Your next, fifty wishes.
NEWMAN: Your nipple's showing.
NEWMAN: Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
NEWMAN:A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
NEWMAN:And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party.
NEWMAN:Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
NEWMAN:Kramer.
NEWMAN:No, but there's karma, Kramer.
NEWMAN:Use me for what?
NEWMAN:Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
NEWMAN:You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
NEWMANEWMAN: ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
NEWS: Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today, when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen.

We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement.

He's described as 5'5 bald and reputedly a very generous tipper.
NEWSSTAND OWNER: Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?
NICK: All morning I been waiting here. All morning.
NICK: Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win, okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology? Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? Anyway, that's it.
NICK: Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives here?
NICK: Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother you. I...I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh, heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?
NICK: I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You won't get away with this!
NICK: If you see him, Could you just tell him the cable company was here?
NICK: Oh, right. I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order.
NICK: Thanks.
NICK: The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with it much longer.
NICK: We can fix that. We can fix that.

NOEL: You're breaking up with me?
NOREEN: ...So you thought he was boring?
NOREEN: Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?
NOREEN: Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.
NOREEN: He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal.
NOREEN: Hm. He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?
NOREEN: I can't believe that was you...
NOREEN: I guess.
NOREEN: I never noticed that.
NOREEN: I'm eating this cookie.
NOREEN: No, I've seen people do it. I like it.
NOREEN: No, why?
NOREEN: Really?
NOREEN: So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up.
NOREEN: Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with him.
NOREEN: Who are you?!
NOREEN: Yeah, well... We're trying... But he just went insane there for a while...
NOREEN: Yeah.

PAT: Where's the jacket?

PAULA: Elaine is in my drawing class at the new school
PAULA: George, I just like to doodle
PAULA: He said that?
PAULA: Hey! Look, no shave.
PAULA: Hi George.
PAULA: How did you know??

PAULA: You decide.
PEGGY: And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
PEGGY: But I've been calling you Susie.
PEGGY: Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?
PEGGY: Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs.
PEGGY: Hey.
PEGGY: I guess I never met Susie.
PEGGY: I heard she was a disaster, Suze--
PEGGY: I'm... gonna get another bottle of water.
PEGGY: Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.
PEGGY: It's not. Good day.
PEGGY: Oh my god! Susie?
PEGGY: Oh, it was no problem.
PEGGY: Oh, thanks, Walter. Ahh!
PEGGY: Please!
PEGGY: Really?
PEGGY: So you... just learned to live with it?
PEGGY: Susie has been very rude to me.
PEGGY: Susie. Susie!
PEGGY: Thanks, Susie.
PEGGY: Yeah. Great.
PEGGY: You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?
PEGGY: You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt. She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.
PEGGY: You seem to be with a lot of men.
PENNY: A contest.
PENNY: A, uh -
PENNY: I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.
PENNY: It was horrible, horrible!
PENNY: It's rather difficult to talk about.
PENNY: Oh please, I can't.
PENNY: The four of them made a wager to see if they could -
PENNY: To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.
PENNY: Well, I became aware of a -
PENNY: Yes.
PENSKY: Costanza? Arthur Pensky.
PENSKY: Damn this city.
PENSKY: Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you.
PENSKY: He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. Looks like you put a lot of work into this.
PENSKY: Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?
PENSKY: Where's Tuttle?
PENSKY: Yes.
PENSKY: You are aware...
PEOPLE AT TABLE: What? What is she talking about? What did she say?
PERFORMED BY: Les Brown
PETE: Hey, let's go get some coffee.
PETER: Seinfeld.....
PETERMAN: ...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
PETERMAN: ...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
PETERMAN: 2.. CBS..
PETERMAN: 3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
PETERMAN: Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
PETERMAN: Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
PETERMAN: Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
PETERMAN: Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.
PETERMAN: All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
PETERMAN: All right, Elaine.
PETERMAN: All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
PETERMAN: Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
PETERMAN: And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
PETERMAN: And I thought I knew what love was.
PETERMAN: And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
PETERMAN: And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
PETERMAN: Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.
PETERMAN: Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, Susie?
PETERMAN: Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick.
PETERMAN: Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too.
PETERMAN: Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
PETERMAN: Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.
PETERMAN: But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
PETERMAN: But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
PETERMAN: Copy-editing!
PETERMAN: Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. And you will be at his side.
PETERMAN: Do they have a castle at Windsor?
PETERMAN: Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
PETERMAN: Doctor, how is she?
PETERMAN: Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her.
PETERMAN: Eh, never mind. Elaine, you do it.
PETERMAN: Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
PETERMAN: Elaine! May I say a few words.
PETERMAN: Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
PETERMAN: Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
PETERMAN: Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
PETERMAN: Elaine, did you hire this man?
PETERMAN: Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
PETERMAN: Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
PETERMAN: Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
PETERMAN: Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
PETERMAN: Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
PETERMAN: Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?
PETERMAN: Elaine, what'd you think?
PETERMAN: Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
PETERMAN: Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
PETERMAN: Elaine.
PETERMAN: Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
PETERMAN: Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
PETERMAN: Elaine. You don't like the movie?
PETERMAN: Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.
PETERMAN: Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
PETERMAN: For the love of God!
PETERMAN: Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
PETERMAN: George!
PETERMAN: George, give him your code!
PETERMAN: George, give me your ATM card!
PETERMAN: George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
PETERMAN: George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
PETERMAN: Ha ha ha ha ha!$219, 000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190, 000.
PETERMAN: Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
PETERMAN: Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
PETERMAN: Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
PETERMAN: Have you been crying?
PETERMAN: How much would you take for the whole lot?
PETERMAN: I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
PETERMAN: I feel the same way. And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have.
PETERMAN: I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
PETERMAN: I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. Just a taste, he said. That was all it took.
PETERMAN: I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
PETERMAN: I think not.
PETERMAN: I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
PETERMAN: I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
PETERMAN: I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
PETERMAN: I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
PETERMAN: I'll give you half that.
PETERMAN: I'm afraid I can't take you.
PETERMAN: I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
PETERMAN: I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
PETERMAN: I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
PETERMAN: Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29, 000.
PETERMAN: It is a real hoot.
PETERMAN: It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
PETERMAN: It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
PETERMAN: It's a Ziggy!
PETERMAN: It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
PETERMAN: It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
PETERMAN: It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
PETERMAN: J. Peterman.
PETERMAN: Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
PETERMAN: Kramer, my friend, consider Elaine at your disposal.
PETERMAN: Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn..
PETERMAN: Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
PETERMAN: Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
PETERMAN: Mmmmm--nah.
PETERMAN: Momma! What are you trying to say?
PETERMAN: Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
PETERMAN: Morty, you're out.
PETERMAN: Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
PETERMAN: My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, All right! Who's dancing? No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started.
PETERMAN: Name your price, man!
PETERMAN: Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.
PETERMAN: No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
PETERMAN: Nonsense! I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
PETERMAN: Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
PETERMAN: Not on my watch! I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
PETERMAN: Now, down to business. I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
PETERMAN: Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
PETERMAN: Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
PETERMAN: Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon.....I wish I was taller I'd like to see that complaint get rectified.
PETERMAN: Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 5:00 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
PETERMAN: Oh, good lord.
PETERMAN: Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
PETERMAN: Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
PETERMAN: Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it.
PETERMAN: Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop.
PETERMAN: One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly . It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
PETERMAN: Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
PETERMAN: Peterman, here.
PETERMAN: See you on Monday.
PETERMAN: Shake off the dew, my friend.
PETERMAN: She is The Best. What was your name again.
PETERMAN: She's gone. Bosco?
PETERMAN: She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
PETERMAN: Snag?
PETERMAN: So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
PETERMAN: So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
PETERMAN: So, I have two tickets for you to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
PETERMAN: So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
PETERMAN: Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.
PETERMAN: That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
PETERMAN: That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
PETERMAN: That noise. That's the noise!
PETERMAN: That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
PETERMAN: That shirt. Where did you get it?
PETERMAN: That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
PETERMAN: That's my coat.
PETERMAN: That's NOT bad!
PETERMAN: That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
PETERMAN: That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
PETERMAN: The fire will eat up this entire block!
PETERMAN: The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing!
PETERMAN: Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.
PETERMAN: There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
PETERMAN: There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
PETERMAN: Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
PETERMAN: Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
PETERMAN: Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
PETERMAN: Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
PETERMAN: We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
PETERMAN: Well, are they here?
PETERMAN: Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.
PETERMAN: Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
PETERMAN: Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.
PETERMAN: well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
PETERMAN: Well, it started out nicely: I'm returning some pants. A very identifiable problem.. I set of down a train tunnel... But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
PETERMAN: Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
PETERMAN: Well, that's pretty exciting. Let's put that in the book.
PETERMAN: Well, where are they?
PETERMAN: Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
PETERMAN: What does that have to do with my clubs?
PETERMAN: What is it?
PETERMAN: Where is she?!
PETERMAN: Who are you?
PETERMAN: Who.
PETERMAN: Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
PETERMAN: Woof!
PETERMAN: Yes, I'm J. Peterman.
PETERMAN: Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine.
PETERMAN: Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this Suze isn't much of a Worker.
PETERMAN: You do?
PETERMAN: You don't say.
PETERMAN: You haven't seen it?
PETERMAN: You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
PETERMAN: You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
PETERMAN: You must be Jerry Seinfeld.
PETERMAN: You want to know something? I no longer need them!
PHARMACIST: Actually, we have a case left.
PHARMACIST: Can I help you?
PHARMACIST: Did you say twenty?
PHARMACIST: Right. So, you're set with twenty-five.
PHARMACIST: Sixty.
PHARMACIST: Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them.
PHARMACIST: Ten?
PHARMACIST: Three.
PHIL: Ah hey Jer.

PHIL: Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story.
PHIL: Oh, look at this, what she's got to breast feed in public.
PHIL: Oh, my God!
PHIL: Ow!
PHIL: Thanks.
PHIL: That's my wife.
PHIL: Well this has been one hell of a night.
PHIL: Well, that's the most important thing. Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! How's he doing?
PHIL: What?
PHIL: Yeah, I'm here.
PHIL: Yeah.
PHIL: Yeah.

PHIL: You know I'm sorry things didn't work out with Elaine. I don't know what I did wrong.
PHIL: You know, you really are beautiful Elaine.
PHIL: You look terrific.
PHILBIN: And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!
PHONE MAN: All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new number.
PHONE MAN: I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
PHONE MAN: Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic.
PHONE MAN: Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job and never came back. Nobody knows what happened.
PHONE MAN: Sign here.

PITT: Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
PITT: Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
PITT: For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
PITT: Grace, yes.

PITT: They're too tight.
PITT: This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
PITT: Tomorrow?
PITT: Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
PITT: Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.
PITT: Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
PITT: Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.
PITT: You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.
PLAYER: Ahh.

POLICE OFFICER: Step out of the car sir.
POLICE OFFICER: That's right it is. Do you know how fast you were going?
POLICE OFFICER: Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide.
POLICE OFFICER: Well, then he became very loud and hysterical. He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go. And when I refused, that's when he began to scream: 'My friend's going to die, my friend's going to die.'

POPPIE: Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.
POPPIE: And what gives you the right to do that?
POPPIE: Because it's a pizza!
POPPIE: Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special.
POPPIE: Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?
POPPIE: Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again!
POPPIE: Hello.
POPPIE: Here it is.
POPPIE: I'm Poppie.
POPPIE: It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!
POPPIE: It's you! It's you!
POPPIE: Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -
POPPIE: Let me show you to your table. Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!
POPPIE: My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.
POPPIE: No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.
POPPIE: No.
POPPIE: Not too much!
POPPIE: Oh, hello, Jerry.
POPPIE: Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation.

POPPIE: That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.
POPPIE: The what?
POPPIE: They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.
POPPIE: Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. Not too high!
POPPIE: Visiting my friend.
POPPIE: Wait a second...what is that?
POPPIE: Welcome
POPPIE: Well?
POPPIE: What's the problem?
POPPIE: When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...
POPPIE: Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!
POPPIE: Yes, it is!
POPPIE: Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.
POPPIE: You! I... I gotta sit down!
POPPIE: You're not welcome!
POPPIE: Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.

POSTMAN: Make a wish, Newman! We've gotta get back to work in three hours!
POSTMASTER GENERAL: I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you: you make a pretty strong case. I mean, just imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs, door to door.
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Last time I checked.
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Now, that's better.
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here?
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer?
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Well, you can just call me Henry.

PUDDY: Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
PUDDY: Hey Benes, How are you?
PUDDY: Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
PUDDY: Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
PUDDY: Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
PUDDY: Hey, Babe.
PUDDY: Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?

PUDDY: Hi.
PUDDY: High-five. On the flip side.
PUDDY: How ya gonna start it?
PUDDY: I can live with that.
PUDDY: I cant give you black at that price.
PUDDY: I dont care for that term.
PUDDY: I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy.
PUDDY: I got to make a pit stop.
PUDDY: I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
PUDDY: I know.
PUDDY: I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
PUDDY: I painted my face.
PUDDY: I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
PUDDY: I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
PUDDY: I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
PUDDY: I'm not the one going to hell.
PUDDY: I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
PUDDY: Insiders deal. High-five.
PUDDY: Is there a problem?
PUDDY: It was stupid.
PUDDY: It's a germ.
PUDDY: It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
PUDDY: It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
PUDDY: It's my new coat.
PUDDY: It's my winter coat.
PUDDY: Im with a customer.
PUDDY: Jerry, I just need your signature here, and well get you that yellow car ready to go.
PUDDY: LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
PUDDY: Let's make out.
PUDDY: Lets finish this up.
PUDDY: Look Elaine, be reasonable.
PUDDY: Nah.
PUDDY: No I'm good.
PUDDY: No way, this is bogus, man!
PUDDY: No, germ-o-phobes.
PUDDY: No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
PUDDY: No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
PUDDY: No.
PUDDY: No.
PUDDY: Not for me.
PUDDY: Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
PUDDY: Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid.
PUDDY: Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.
PUDDY: Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!
PUDDY: Oh, like scrump.
PUDDY: Oh, no.
PUDDY: Oh, so youre leaving?
PUDDY: Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room right there.
PUDDY: Oh, we dont even know what it is.
PUDDY: Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
PUDDY: Ok, ready to go?
PUDDY: Ok.
PUDDY: Okay.
PUDDY: Ow!
PUDDY: Paper jam.. Got it!
PUDDY: Peggy took a turn for the worst.
PUDDY: Puddy.
PUDDY: Right, Koko. That chimps all right. High-five.
PUDDY: Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
PUDDY: Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.
PUDDY: So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
PUDDY: So what do you think?
PUDDY: Sorry Im late.
PUDDY: Sorry, thou shalt not steal.
PUDDY: Sure thing, Joe Mayo.
PUDDY: Talk to me, Babe.
PUDDY: Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
PUDDY: That's right.
PUDDY: That's right.
PUDDY: That's the letter 'D'.
PUDDY: That's what he said.
PUDDY: Theres a mental hospital right near here.
PUDDY: They're bacteria traps.
PUDDY: This is Puddy.
PUDDY: Two and ten, babe.
PUDDY: We're primed.
PUDDY: Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
PUDDY: Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
PUDDY: Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
PUDDY: Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
PUDDY: Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
PUDDY: Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
PUDDY: Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
PUDDY: Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is.
PUDDY: What did I tell you about that?
PUDDY: What do you care, you know where you're going.
PUDDY: What?
PUDDY: What?
PUDDY: Why not?
PUDDY: Yeah, I know.
PUDDY: Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
PUDDY: Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.
PUDDY: Yeah, if you leave, were through.
PUDDY: Yeah, that's right.
PUDDY: Yeah, that's right.
PUDDY: Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
PUDDY: Yeah.
PUDDY: Yeah.
PUDDY: Yeah.
PUDDY: Yeah? So are you. Youre the grease monkey.
PUDDY: Yes.
PUDDY: You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
PUDDY: You gotta be kidding, how come?
PUDDY: You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
PUDDY: You know, support the team.
PUDDY: You owe me five.
PUDDY: You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
PUDDY: You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
PUERTO RICAN MAN: Buenos dias, my friend.
PUERTO RICAN MAN: Well, it is our day.
RABBI: A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.
RABBI: Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.
RABBI: Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?
RABBI: Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.
RABBI: Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?
RABBI: Don Ramsey?
RABBI: Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions.
RABBI: Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?
RABBI: Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled.
RABBI: Good evening. And how does this evening find you?
RABBI: Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.
RABBI: He owns a flower store. Very successful.
RABBI: How wonderful.
RABBI: I hope she's feeling better.
RABBI: I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.
RABBI: Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.
RABBI: She came off as pretty desperate.
RABBI: She didn't tell you?
RABBI: The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.
RABBI: Was that a problem for you?
RABBI: Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.
RABBI: Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .
RABBI: Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.
RABBI: Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories
RABBI: Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.
RABBI: Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going to happen for you.
RABBI: You know my temple has many single functions.
RABBI: You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?
RABBI: You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.
RACHEL: Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
RACHEL: C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.

RACHEL: I'm gonna take a swim.
RACHEL: I've been doing a lot of thinking.
RACHEL: It's been soo long.
RACHEL: It's night meeting you.
RACHEL: Jerry ...
RACHEL: Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
RACHEL: Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
RACHEL: Mm-hmm.
RACHEL: No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.
RACHEL: No.
RACHEL: Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry.
RACHEL: Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
RACHEL: Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
RACHEL: Ok, it's only two more days.
RACHEL: So where is this baby, anyway?
RACHEL: Strange man.
RACHEL: There's lobster in these eggs?
RACHEL: Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
RACHEL: Umm... This is so good.
RACHEL: We don't have any gum.
RACHEL: Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
RACHEL: Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
RACHEL: What'd you want anyway, George?
RACHEL: What?
RACHEL: When are they leaving?
RACHEL: Why not?
RACHEL: Yea.
RACHEL: Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
RACHEL: Yeah, what's the big deal?
RACHEL: Yeah, you too.
RACHEL: Yes, I do. Thank you.
RACHEL: You will?
RACHEL: You're right, I would have.

RAQUEL: Out with it!
RAQUEL: That's it, you are going down.
RAQUEL: What kind of problem?
RAQUEL: What the hell is that? Are you making fun of my dancing?
RAQUEL: Who are you?
RAQUEL: You are a fraud Dr Tarnover. You haven't even been to Scarsdale.
RAQUEL: You know who I am. Now, what are you doing?
RAVA: Ah those are the pastries, Ray take care of that, I'm going to get Elaine the manuscript.
RAVA: And we have to get back to work.
RAVA: Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? Well?! Well?!
RAVA: Daantotin. Theres Ray... late as usual.
RAVA: Demand.
RAVA: I admit nothing!
RAVA: Maybe I put it out on your face! Its just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. Youre trying to destroy us.
RAVA: Maybe you think were in cahoots.
RAVA: My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. We never heard from her again. I hope shes rotting in an alley somewhere!
RAVA: No, there are only coincidences! Ask anyone!
RAVA: No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.
RAVA: Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!
RAVA: Of course.
RAVA: Or maybe hes dead.
RAVA: Ray, would you give me a hand?
RAVA: So you think he stole it?!
RAVA: Thats Ray.
RAVA: Thats what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!
RAVA: The water is boiling. Are you having tea?
RAVA: Was Jerry?
RAVA: Well, if they dont let you be my editor on this book, Ill go to another publisher. Its that simple.
RAVA: Why should I be?
RAVA: Yes, thats all: a coincidence!
RAVA: You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.
RAVA: Your notes are very insightful.
RAY: Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
RAY: Ah, sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.
RAY: Ah, the pastries!
RAY: And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
RAY: Are you saying I stole your statue?
RAY: Are you talking to me?
RAY: Bob.
RAY: But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
RAY: Do you take sugar?
RAY: For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.
RAY: Give it back to whom?
RAY: Give it back?
RAY: Got you? I dont even know what the hell youre talking about.
RAY: Hey, hey, are you a cop?
RAY: Hey.
RAY: How about dinner?
RAY: I cant believe what Im hearing.
RAY: I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
RAY: I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
RAY: I said, are you talking to me?
RAY: I think you have me confused with somebody else.
RAY: I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
RAY: If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
RAY: Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
RAY: It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
RAY: Im not getting this.
RAY: Im talking about the statue.
RAY: Ive got to get going. I have a class.
RAY: Lemon?
RAY: Look at this.
RAY: Murder?!
RAY: Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?
RAY: Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
RAY: Police?
RAY: Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
RAY: Shes from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!
RAY: Well, thats because Im registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
RAY: Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty.
RAY: What are you saying?
RAY: What are you talking about?
RAY: What did you say?
RAY: Whats behind this? Its Rava, isnt it?
RAY: Whats going on here?
RAY: Who is this?
RAY: Yeah, Im coming!
RAY: Yeah.
RAY: Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments.
RAY: Yes?
RAY: You are starting to make me angry!
RAY: You want her.
RAY: You?
RAY: Your friend is crazy.
RAY: Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.

RESTAURATEUR: I'm a busy man
RESTAURATEUR: I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven dollars... ...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk...
RESTAURATEUR: Really? Well, I smell you now.
RESTAURATEUR: Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you!
RESTAURATEUR: Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour...
RESTAURATEUR: What do you mean-- stunk up?
RESTAURATEUR: Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!
RESTON: ...About anything. You have my number.
RESTON: Could I offer you something to drink. Uhm, coffee? Anything?

RHISA: You want to borrow money, right?
RICARDI: Excuse me, George?
RICARDI: No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association.
RICARDI: Shipwreck.
RICARDI: Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony.
RICARDI: Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him.
RICHIE: So what's going on?
RICK: Actually, it looks like were gonna need some gas.
RICK: Ah, you can just go on without me.
RICK: Ahh!
RICK: But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad!
RICK: Do you have my card?
RICK: Have you ever been completely below the slash?
RICK: How low are you gonna go?
RICK: I see. So, youre his manag-
RICK: I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.
RICK: Is it just the angle Im looking from?
RICK: Its Rick, by the way.
RICK: Maybe I should talk to him.
RICK: Maybe we better get moving.
RICK: Mr. Kramer, the road!
RICK: Mr. Kramer, the road!
RICK: No, no coconut for me.
RICK: No, they drove off a cliff.
RICK: Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now.
RICK: Oh, this is amazing! Oh, Ive never felt so alive!
RICK: So, you want to know how far you can drive your friends car for free.
RICK: Theres the dealer!
RICK: Uh, Mr. Kramer, were really not allowed to use the cars to run errands.
RICK: We did! We pulled it off! I cant believe it! Wheres the needle?
RICK: We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan.
RICK: Well where are we going?
RICK: Well, its on E.
RICK: Well, thats okay. Well make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership.
RICK: What? Well, we cant stop now.
RICK: Where is it now?
RICK: You - you can probably let go of my hand now.
RICKEY: John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!
RICKY: Come on Elaine, let's go.
RICKY: Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.
RICKY: Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television.
RICKY: Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.
RICKY: He's not? Interesting.
RICKY: Hello. Is Elaine home?
RICKY: Hey miss! You forgot this!
RICKY: Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?
RICKY: Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
RICKY: Highlighter?
RICKY: I don't have one.
RICKY: I like the special fall preview issues the best.
RICKY: I made this for you.
RICKY: Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide.
RICKY: Oh, 'kay, see. On this particular Tuesday you could've watched six hours of Lucy. There's I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy.
RICKY: Oh, this is a good one.
RICKY: These are worth like, a lot of money.
RICKY: To highlight the programmes you plan to watch.
RICKY: TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.
RICKY: Yes.
RITA: Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.
RITA: Boy, talk about a show about nothing.
RITA: Good.
RITA: He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.
RITA: Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.
RITA: Hey everybody! Here come the runners!
RITA: Hi Jerry, this is Rita Kierson.
RITA: How pathetic.
RITA: I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. Its great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, shes a very luck woman. Enjoy the race.
RITA: I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network.
RITA: I'm Rita Kearson.
RITA: In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show.
RITA: Is she here?
RITA: Oh, hi. Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.
RITA: So how are you guys comin' along?
RITA: So that's the idea?
RITA: To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.
RITA: Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry.
RITA: Well, I think we should get started anyway.
RITA: What does she do?
RITA: What's with him? Russell? Russell?
RITA: Where is Russell?
RITA: You O.K.?
RIVERA: And so we wait.
RIVERA: And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?
RIVERA: Anything else, Jane?
RIVERA: Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane -
RIVERA: Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-
RIVERA: Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?
RIVERA: That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.
RIVERA: Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.
RIVERA: What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
ROBBER: Alright fatso, out of the car.
ROBBER: Come on! Gimme your wallet.
ROBBER: I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on.

ROBERT: I've really got to thank you for this.
ROBERT: Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.
ROBERT: Upstairs?
ROBERT: Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow.
ROBERT: You almost convinced me we were a couple.
ROBERTA: That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.
ROBERTA: What should we do?
ROBERTA: Why am I first?
ROBIN: But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!
ROBIN: But you yelled get out of my way!
ROBIN: Do you think 25 kids is too much?
ROBIN: George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.
ROBIN: George! This is Ronnie Kaye!
ROBIN: George, what is it? I'm working.
ROBIN: George...
ROBIN: George...
ROBIN: He was only joking Michael! Sorry.
ROBIN: He was only joking Michael.
ROBIN: Hi Mom, how's everything?
ROBIN: I am not taking his side.
ROBIN: If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.
ROBIN: In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.
ROBIN: L-listen, Listen...I gotta think about this.
ROBIN: Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.
ROBIN: Oh no, what's wrong?
ROBIN: So, what about entertainment? Should I get Barney?
ROBIN: Thank you.
ROBIN: The burgers should be ready in a minute.
ROBIN: Well I'm not taking your side!
ROBIN: Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.
ROBIN: What are you talking about?
ROBIN: What was his name?
ROBIN: Where did you meet him?
ROBIN: You didn't commit adultery, I did.
ROBIN: You went out with a bullfighter?
ROCHELLE: My name is Rochelle, I'm from Milan. I'm supposed to visit my relatives in Minsk.

RONNIE: Hey, man. Good set.
RONNIE: Hey.
RONNIE: How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it.
RONNIE: I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?
RONNIE: Is it possible for nostrils to expand?
RONNIE: Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me.
RONNIE: Yeah. You?
RONNIE: You know Leonard Christian's here?
ROXANNE: Hi Stan. Joanne.
ROXANNE: Hi, Elaine.
ROXANNE: I wish we had a view of the finish line.
ROXANNE: Oh, the marathon is great, isnt it?

ROXANNE: There are so few true heroes left in this world.
ROXANNE: Youre all winners!
ROY: *Elaine*! What a *surprise*.
ROY: After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks.
ROY: Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.
ROY: Do you like him?
ROY: Do you like him?
ROY: Don't be ridiculous. Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?
ROY: Don't mind her.
ROY: Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.
ROY: Heeyy - there's the guy who saved my life.
ROY: Hey, George...
ROY: How come you don't like him?
ROY: I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.
ROY: I know.
ROY: Nah nah, it's ok.
ROY: Next Thursday.
ROY: Oh, hey Dr. Siegel.
ROY: Oh, How do you do?
ROY: Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi.
ROY: Really, it's the truth.
ROY: She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.
ROY: So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday?
ROY: So, you want the notes?
ROY: Thank you.
ROY: Thank you. So do you.
ROY: Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.
ROY: Yeah, ya know, I've lost some weight...
ROY: Yesss, I remember.
ROY: You did.
ROY: You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what'cha did for me.

RUDY: It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.
RUDY: Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.
RUDY: Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.
RUDY: Lousy moth ridden crap.
RUDY: Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.

RULA: You are. Some coffee cake?
RUSSEL: And people really have to care about the characters.
RUSSEL: Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.
RUSSEL: So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.
RUSSEL: So, let's make a pilot.
RUSSEL: We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.
RUSSEL: Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment.
RUSSELL: All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- I don't understand, we went out once...
RUSSELL: All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?
RUSSELL: All right. All right. What's your name?
RUSSELL: Alright, now look. These deals are already made.
RUSSELL: Alright. Eight thousand.
RUSSELL: Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...
RUSSELL: Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.
RUSSELL: Blossom's on Monday.
RUSSELL: But I want you.
RUSSELL: Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW!
RUSSELL: Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.
RUSSELL: Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine?
RUSSELL: Excuse me for a second.
RUSSELL: For example, what did you do today?
RUSSELL: Get out! You're fired!
RUSSELL: How is that a show?
RUSSELL: I got up and came to work.
RUSSELL: I really appreciate you coming.
RUSSELL: I'll call back.
RUSSELL: Is it something I said... or did?
RUSSELL: It's just a stomach thing.
RUSSELL: It's not veal.
RUSSELL: Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team.
RUSSELL: Mister Costanza.
RUSSELL: No stories? So, what is it?
RUSSELL: No, I... ...don't have a ketchup secret.
RUSSELL: No.
RUSSELL: No.
RUSSELL: Not even close.
RUSSELL: Not yet.
RUSSELL: Nothing?
RUSSELL: Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
RUSSELL: Oh. Hello.
RUSSELL: Pfeiffer's.
RUSSELL: Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...
RUSSELL: She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me.
RUSSELL: So, what have you two come up with?
RUSSELL: So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?
RUSSELL: Thank you.
RUSSELL: There's a show. that's a show.
RUSSELL: This is Cynthia.
RUSSELL: Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together.
RUSSELL: We were about to sit down to dinner.
RUSSELL: Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. So, what were you saying?
RUSSELL: Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.
RUSSELL: Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.
RUSSELL: Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.
RUSSELL: Well, why am I watching it?
RUSSELL: What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?
RUSSELL: What are you saying?
RUSSELL: What does that mean?
RUSSELL: What?
RUSSELL: Who gave you my address?
RUSSELL: Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.
RUSSELL: Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.
RUSSELL: Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second.
RUSSELL: Yeah. The food's usually terrific.
RUSSELL: Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met...
RUSSELL: You read? You read on the show?
RUSTY: Oh, there you are. Oh, do I get the job?
RUTHIE: Same.
SAILOR: Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.
SAL BASS: He's a member of our health club. Isn't he?
SAL BASS: You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts?
SALES WOMAN: Did the broker send you over?
SALES WOMAN: I'm Christine Nyhart.
SALES WOMAN: It has 4.
SALES WOMAN: It's down the hall.
SALES WOMAN: Just down the hall.
SALES WOMAN: Mr. Pennypacker!
SALES WOMAN: Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay, And you know Mr. Varnsen
SALES WOMAN: Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist.
SALES WOMAN: No.
SALES WOMAN: Oh, here. This is why.
SALES WOMAN: Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.
SALES WOMAN: See this red dot?
SALES WOMAN: The asking price is $1.5 million.
SALES WOMAN: There's no exchanges on this.
SALES WOMAN: Well, it's--
SALES WOMAN: Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, um--
SALES WOMAN: Yes! Come in, come in.
SALES WOMAN: Yes?
SALES WOMAN: You know him?
SALES WOMAN: You two know each other?
SALESMAN: 6200.
SALESMAN: All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series, Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm Superstream, you name it.
SALESMAN: All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?!
SALESMAN: Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat.
SALESMAN: As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.
SALESMAN: Can I help you with something?
SALESMAN: Excuse me Mr Ross.
SALESMAN: For example, your tremor-damping.
SALESMAN: Hop in!
SALESMAN: How about $240?
SALESMAN: How many miles you got on this thing?
SALESMAN: I can't sell this car.
SALESMAN: I got a LeBaron convertible right here.
SALESMAN: I tell ya...
SALESMAN: I'll be right with you.
SALESMAN: Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.
SALESMAN: It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.
SALESMAN: It looks wonderful on you.
SALESMAN: It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight.
SALESMAN: Nah, believe me. It's only used in the circus. For elephants.
SALESMAN: No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think you're being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life!
SALESMAN: Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.
SALESMAN: Sir, are you gonna buy a car?
SALESMAN: That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi-
SALESMAN: This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.
SALESMAN: Well, how do you know that ones yours?
SALESMAN: Well, I might have something in the back.
SALESMAN: What are you looking for?
SALESMAN: What year did you say this was?
SALESMAN: When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.
SALESMAN: You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
SALESMAN: Youve got a good eye, there. I see youve noticed the uni-body construction. Im Rick. Are you looking to buy or to lease?
SALESWOMAN: Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday.
SALESWOMAN: Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have.
SALESWOMAN: Hey, Willie, check it out! Free candy!
SALESWOMAN: I don't know.
SALESWOMAN: I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar Gaultier dress.
SALESWOMAN: I told you, I don't know.
SALESWOMAN: I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price.
SALESWOMAN: I'm getting the manager.
SALESWOMAN: Is someone helping you?
SALESWOMAN: It fits you perfectly.
SALESWOMAN: It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it.
SALESWOMAN: Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.
SALESWOMAN: What is her problem?
SALESWOMAN: Why?
SALESWOMAN: Yeah? What law am I breaking?
SALESWOMAN: Yes.
SALESWOMAN: You are perfect for that suit.

SALLY: Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!
SALLY: Jerry, sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?
SALLY: Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.
SALLY: No, but he should be home soon.
SALLY: No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.
SALLY: No, no.. It's just a little performance piece I wrote... You know what? You really inspired me, oKay, a tear.
SALLY: Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?
SALLY: Oh well, I'll be watching. Don't screw up.
SALLY: Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you out to dinner.
SALLY: Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! You know what, um.. You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. It's a wedding present.
SALLY: Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And he's like Hey stop doing your show. and I'm like, Hello! It's a free country. So then he goes. Okay Shmootsie and he starts pulling at my sweater right?. He's getting, you know, Hands Across America.
SALLY: Okay.
SALLY: Really?
SALLY: Right!, Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it.
SALLY: Sally Weaver! Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello!
SALLY: Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.
SALLY: That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. The Pride of Memphis!
SALLY: This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as kind of a joke.
SALLY: To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld. Signed ; Crybaby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer. Ok but I got two words for you Jerry Seinfeld......You
SALLY: Well, here I am!
SALLY: Well, lay it on me string bean.

SALLY: You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but I'll tell you what I'll think... It's all a journey.

SASHA: Twenty five dollars.
SASHA: We cant keep seeing each other.
SASHA: Yes. Ill have the lobster.

SHELLBACH: Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no central nervous system.

SHELLY: What's the matter?
SHELLY: Yeah!
SHERRY: I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.
SHERRY: Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think.
SHERRY: No, Tropic of Capricorn
SHERRY: Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?
SHERRY: Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... As I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse .
SHERRY: Uch! Licorice gum? Never! We were ah, reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,
SHERRY: Where ya' going?
SHLOMO: Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got him!
SHLOMO: He looks like a Frog.
SHLOMO: I definitely thought we're stealing it.
SHLOMO: I don't know If I'm the best.
SHLOMO: I thought the bathroom was here.
SHLOMO: Let's say good.
SHLOMO: So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?
SHLOMO: They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh.
SHLOMO: Which one's the bathroom?
SHOWALTER: Cotton, huh?
SHOWALTER: How so?
SHOWALTER: Sure, George.
SHOWALTER: Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing...
SHOWALTER: You may have something there, George.
SID: Agency? What agency? The *CIA*?
SID: Good. Thank God. Good riddance. Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!!
SID: Hey Morty. Who's this?
SID: Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums outta here.
SID: Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can.
SID: Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.
SID: Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?
SID: I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.
SID: I can't read that you fool...
SID: I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars.
SID: I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.
SID: If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday.
SID: It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage.
SID: Jerry, you got insurance, right?
SID: Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on?
SID: My teeth! My teeth!
SID: My teeth! You idiots!!!
SID: Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?
SID: No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.
SID: Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you little...
SID: Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that.
SID: Oh *her*. She *steals* from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My *ass* she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' voo-doo music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house...
SID: Oh lord.
SID: Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend. Are you going to *kill* me? I'm an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!?
SID: Somebody, call an ambulance.
SID: That's not so funny.
SID: Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.
SID: Trash. Garbage.
SID: Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it.
SID: Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, *Ein-stein*.
SID: Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all.
SID: Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family.
SID: Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted.
SID: What kind of stupid show is this? Hey! It's that idiot that took all my records!
SID: What the *Hell* is it?
SID: What!?!
SID: What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?
SID: Who let you in here?
SID: Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars.
SID: Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want.
SID: Why don't you start taking the bus?
SID: With you? I'd rather be dead.
SIDRA: A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
SIDRA: Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
SIDRA: Come on, Jackie. Let's go.
SIDRA: Good. How you doin'?
SIDRA: He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
SIDRA: Hi...Elaine?
SIDRA: I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
SIDRA: I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy.
SIDRA: I hear that's how she died.
SIDRA: I think you're both mentally ill. And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular.
SIDRA: I was just leaving.
SIDRA: It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.
SIDRA: O.K....
SIDRA: Oh, hi Jerry.
SIDRA: Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.
SIDRA: Oh, that's o.k.
SIDRA: So you can relate?
SIDRA: Thursday night.
SIDRA: We were in the sauna, making chit-chat.
SIDRA: Well, a lot of women are having them done.
SIDRA: Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. Aren't you going to get that?
SIDRA: What do you tell them?
SIDRA: What if it's an emergency?
SIDRA: Why?
SIDRA: Yeah.
SIDRA: Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
SIDRA: Yeah...
SIDRA: Yes! How did you know?
SIDRA: Yes, that's true.
SIDRA: Yes.
SIDRA: Yes.
SIDRA: You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie.
SIENA: Hey, that's ok. Well, I've gotta go feed the marmosets.
SIENA: Oh, well.
SIENA: So why didn't you?
SIENA: That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper.
SIENA: Wow.
SIENA: Yeah, I know. I heard you the first time.
SIENA: Yeah, you're right George. What else can they do?
SIENA: Yes. yes, I do.
SIENA: You know, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.
SILVIO: A man's?
SILVIO: But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
SILVIO: Eh, what are you doing?
SILVIO: Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?
SILVIO: I deal with him.
SILVIO: I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
SILVIO: If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?
SILVIO: Jerry?
SILVIO: Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.
SILVIO: Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.
SILVIO: Like what?
SILVIO: Look at this.
SILVIO: Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.
SILVIO: Newman? He did this, too?
SILVIO: No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!
SILVIO: No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.
SILVIO: No, that's it. You're both out of the building!
SILVIO: OK, on your word he can stay.
SILVIO: Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?
SILVIO: That is your coat?
SILVIO: Then who?
SILVIO: What kind of a man would wear fur?
SILVIO: What's wrong?
SILVIO: Who's Joe Mayo?
SILVIO: Why are we in Jerry's apartment?
SILVIO: Would you?
SILVIO: Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!

SIMON: What?

SIMON: Yes Apart from that, dreadful airline food. It tends to reek havoc with my stomach.

SOPHIE: Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny.
SOPHIE: Bought the farm?
SOPHIE: But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit.
SOPHIE: Hey Raef.
SOPHIE: Hey. It's me.
SOPHIE: How could you know?
SOPHIE: I move my knight... here. Check.
SOPHIE: Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?
SOPHIE: Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.
SOPHIE: No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.
SOPHIE: No, it's me.
SOPHIE: Not a lot.
SOPHIE: Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story.
SOPHIE: This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable.
SOPHIE: Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor.
SOPHIE: You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.

STAN: Nice to meet you. Ready to hit the links, Kramer?
STAN: No, no buts. We made up our minds. We want Kramer. He showed us how much he cares about Steven.
STAN: Oh, no. Not the left arm!
STAN: She can pop in whenever she wants.
STAN: The most important thing is you help with the bris.
STAN: There's nothing wrong with the baby.
STAN: This doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it?
STAN: What are those, ah, cotton pants?
STAN: Will you look at that kid. Sucking away. Sucking like there's no tomorrow. Suck, suck, suck...

STEIN: Yes it is. Well lets see what I have today. Darn it It's ham & Cheese again and she forgot the fancy mustard. I told her I like that fancy mustard. You could put that fancy mustard on a shoe and it would taste pretty good to me. oh! she made it up with a cupcake though. Hey look at this. you know I got a new system for eating these things. `I used to peel off the chocolate now I turn them upside down, I eat the cake first and save the frosting for the end. When you're smiling, When you're smiling... The whole world smiles with you... When you're laughin', When you're laughin' The sun comes shining through But when you're crying, You bring on the rain So stop that sign. Be happy again Keep on smiling, 'cause when you're smiling The whole world smiles with yooooouuuuuuu The whole world smiles with yooooouuuuuuu..
STEINBRENNER: ...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation needed.
STEINBRENNER: ???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear.
STEINBRENNER: A bomb in the building, oh, m'god. Quick, everyone under the desk.
STEINBRENNER: A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.
STEINBRENNER: A lot more work you know.
STEINBRENNER: Ade, Ade, I like that name George.
STEINBRENNER: Ah, come in George, come in.
STEINBRENNER: Ah, Wilhelm.
STEINBRENNER: All right George, you can handle that.
STEINBRENNER: Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen.
STEINBRENNER: Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Bcause I got a flash for you young man, you're non compos mentis! You got some bats in the belfry!
STEINBRENNER: Back to Business Wilhelm!
STEINBRENNER: Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies.
STEINBRENNER: But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have to dock you for the time you missed. We're running a ball club here. If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos! And I can tell you this, chaos does not work for the New York Yankees! Not as long as I'm running the show!
STEINBRENNER: Come in!
STEINBRENNER: Come in, come in.
STEINBRENNER: Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more desks. Just Lucite tables and four leSTEINBRENNER.
STEINBRENNER: Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.
STEINBRENNER: Costanza what the hell are you doing?
STEINBRENNER: Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excusé mois? Have you seen Costanza?
STEINBRENNER: Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing with you. All right boys send it in
STEINBRENNER: Find him, Wilhelm!
STEINBRENNER: Find out where his parents live.
STEINBRENNER: George, I've read this report. It's very troubling, very troubling indeed. It's a sick mind at work here.
STEINBRENNER: Good morning to you, Wilhelm.
STEINBRENNER: Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...
STEINBRENNER: Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.
STEINBRENNER: He had one little problem though.
STEINBRENNER: He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.
STEINBRENNER: He's dead! ca-Costanza's dead!
STEINBRENNER: Hello are you the bomber?
STEINBRENNER: Hey you kids know tunes; see if this song rinSTEINBRENNER a bell, Heartbreaker, . . .
STEINBRENNER: Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for?
STEINBRENNER: How 'bout a 'good morning'?
STEINBRENNER: How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?
STEINBRENNER: I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets.
STEINBRENNER: I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.
STEINBRENNER: I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass.
STEINBRENNER: I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning...
STEINBRENNER: I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi...
STEINBRENNER: I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.
STEINBRENNER: Is that a fact George?
STEINBRENNER: Just let me ask you something. Is it February or  February? Because I prefer Febuary and what is this ru?
STEINBRENNER: Let me ask you something, George. You having any personal problems at home? Girl trouble, love trouble of any kind?
STEINBRENNER: Macho head games?
STEINBRENNER: Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it.
STEINBRENNER: Mrs. Costanza?
STEINBRENNER: My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some very sad new about your son.
STEINBRENNER: Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve.
STEINBRENNER: Of course you didn't George. Of course you didn't write it.
STEINBRENNER: Of course. Of course it got done. Things get done all the time, I understand. Don't worry, your job'll be waiting for you when you get back. Get better George. Get better!
STEINBRENNER: Oh my God. Do you know what this means, Wilhelm?
STEINBRENNER: Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. I've got two words to say to you, George hot tub.
STEINBRENNER: Oh, as quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little guy! Easy. Easy, big Stein, get it together. Ok, Wilhelm.
STEINBRENNER: Okay, come on boys, come on in here. George, this is Herb and Dan.
STEINBRENNER: Put everyone on alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've gotta find that kid.
STEINBRENNER: Stop it George, he's out, you're in.
STEINBRENNER: Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just cant even make up my mind. A lot of times Ill mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge.
STEINBRENNER: Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing.
STEINBRENNER: That's what they call me.
STEINBRENNER: They're gonna take you away to a nice place where you can get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law was there for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. They completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese.
STEINBRENNER: Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies.
STEINBRENNER: Uh, Wilhelm gave me this project you worked on.
STEINBRENNER: Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. She's a heart breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh . . .very catchy. You know what? I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh?
STEINBRENNER: we can't grieve forever!
STEINBRENNER: We gotta get back to business!
STEINBRENNER: We must find George.
STEINBRENNER: We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. Babe Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's something I just found out recently. He wasn't really a sultan. Ah, what d'you make of that? Hey, check this out. Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit. Hey, you don't think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 'em off. I'm too important to this team. Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching.
STEINBRENNER: Well what do you want instead?
STEINBRENNER: Well, Buhner was a good prospect, no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat. They kept saying 'Ken Phelps, Ken Phelps'.
STEINBRENNER: Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager.
STEINBRENNER: Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. That kid was a human dynamo.
STEINBRENNER: Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our hands. We had to make a move...
STEINBRENNER: Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something.
STEINBRENNER: What about drugs? You doing some of that crack cocaine? You on the pipe?
STEINBRENNER: What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something.
STEINBRENNER: What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come in.
STEINBRENNER: What is with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half hours. Should I go? No way Jack! ??? at the registrar again, I'll tell you that.
STEINBRENNER: What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the crazies again?
STEINBRENNER: What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter?
STEINBRENNER: What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?
STEINBRENNER: Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. Streak on. Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the game today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets. Owner's box, that's gotta bring in forty bucks, no problem.
STEINBRENNER: With this magnifying glass, I feel like a scientist.
STEINBRENNER: Yes George, I did. Come in, come in. George, the wordaround the office is that you're a Communist.
STEINBRENNER: Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- Im a very accessible man. I just wanted to say you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff.
STEINBRENNER: Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit.
STEINBRENNER: Yes, George, please, come in, come in.
STEINBRENNER: Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?
STEINBRENNER: Yes, yes, come in.
STEINBRENNER: You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?
STEINBRENNER: You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job.
STEINBRENNER: You could be invaluable to this franchise. George, there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look at; something Rodriguez, I don't really know his name. You get yourselfdown to Havana right away.
STEINBRENNER: You don't want them, then goodbye.
STEINBRENNER: You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization.
STEINBRENNER: You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb ahead of time.
STEINBRENNER: You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous.
STEINBRENNER: You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. Hello, ah, George will you excuse me.
STELLA: Hello.
STELLA: Humm... We saw you on The Tonight Show last week.
STELLA: Morty are you nervous?
STELLA: This better be good. I'm missing Golden Girls for this.
STEVE: Ah, look who's here.
STEVE: Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
STEVE: Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.
STEVE: Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
STEVE: Don't be so enthusiastic.
STEVE: Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
STEVE: He he, go for it.
STEVE: He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?
STEVE: Hey Cosmo.
STEVE: Hey, I might take you up on that.
STEVE: Hey, this is for close friends only.
STEVE: Hey, you want in on this?
STEVE: I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. Ooh, there's my ride, finally.
STEVE: I think I can do that.
STEVE: I understand.
STEVE: I'll go first.
STEVE: I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.
STEVE: I'm not gonna steal anything.
STEVE: I'm waiting for my ride.
STEVE: Jerry, baby!
STEVE: Jerry, this is Patti.
STEVE: Kramer, right?
STEVE: Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
STEVE: No problem.
STEVE: No, I just live here.
STEVE: Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry
STEVE: Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.
STEVE: See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.
STEVE: See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.
STEVE: Somebody's going to make that crap?
STEVE: Something I said? It's John... Mollika.
STEVE: That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
STEVE: What about it?
STEVE: What are you talking about?
STEVE: What're you doing down here?
STEVE: What's in it for me?
STEVE: What's the plan?
STEVE: Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. Ouch. Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.
STEVE: Yeah, so?
STEVE: Yeah. Let's have lunch.
STEVE: You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.
STEVE: You think so?
STEVEN: Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher.
STEVEN: I don't know.. I made it up. I'm never gonna get this thing.
STEVEN: I think I'd really like to be a city planner. Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a whole city?
STEVEN: I want my scholarship back, so I can be a city planner.
STEVEN: I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..
STEVEN: Nastercoff?
STEVEN: So, Mister Costanza, did you get my scholarship back?
STEVEN: State champs.
STEVEN: Thank you.
STEVEN: Thank you.
STEVEN: That's not the sign.
STEVEN: These are my new friends - The Van Buren Boys.
STEVEN: Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler?
STEVEN: Why'd you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza?
STEWARDESS: Could I take that box for you?
STEWARDESS: I'm afraid not.
STEWARDESS: No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.
STEWARDESS: Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head.
STEWARDESS: There we go.
STOCK BOY: No puffs. Just flakes.
STORE MANAGER: Is there a problem here?
STORE MANAGER: Not anymore. Get your skinny ass out of here.
STORE MANAGER: Oh yeah? Well that's enough pinko! You're through. The both of ya'
STRANGER: Do I know you?
STRANGER: Nice day.
STRANGER: Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.
STREET TOUGH: Looking for something, lady?
STREET TOUGH: The bank? It burned. It's gone!
STU: Ah, it's a real bear.
STU: And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.
STU: Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.
STU: Could we speak for a few moments?

STU: Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. Listen, Kenny. Really funny out there.
STU: Kramer.
STU: Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.

STU: Pineapple.
STU: So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.
STU: The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.
STU: This is James Kimbrough.
STU: Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.
STU: Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.
STU: Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?
STU: Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.
STU: Yeah. Right.
STU: You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.
STU: You remember Jay Crespi.
STU: You think he stole them?

TIA: So, he says, ``squeeze your breasts together'', and I say, ``I thought this was an ad for shoes''...

TIA: Yeah.
TICKET LADY: Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now.
TICKET LADY: I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.
TICKET LADY: There's no time.
TICKET MAN: Here it is. I need some I.D.
TICKET MAN: I'm afraid not.
TICKET MAN: I'm sorry. I need proof.
TICKET MAN: Neither do I. But without I.D., I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket.
TICKET MAN: Well, I can't give it to you then.
TIERNEY: A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test.
TIERNEY: Have you ever seen the show?
TIERNEY: Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly.
TIERNEY: Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks?
TIERNEY: If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose Place.
TIERNEY: Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.
TIERNEY: Yeah. I think you've seen it.
TIERNEY: You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.
TIM: 5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
TIM: Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
TIM: All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
TIM: Alright, get down!
TIM: Alright, let me take down your number. Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
TIM: And of course, his great book, The Game.
TIM: And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
TIM: And you really don't look like a Murphy.
TIM: Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
TIM: But you gave it to me.
TIM: eh?
TIM: Elaine! Hi!
TIM: Elaine, hi.
TIM: Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
TIM: Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
TIM: Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
TIM: Hey Jerry?
TIM: Hey! Happy Chanukah!
TIM: Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.'
TIM: Hey, Jerry.
TIM: How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
TIM: I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
TIM: I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
TIM: I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
TIM: I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
TIM: I'm sorry.
TIM: It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
TIM: It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.
TIM: Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
TIM: Jerry.
TIM: Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.
TIM: Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
TIM: Mazel Tov.
TIM: No, it's no problem, what is it?
TIM: No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?
TIM: No. The periodontist.
TIM: Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
TIM: Oh yeah, me too.
TIM: Oh, Elaine!
TIM: Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
TIM: Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. Happy Chanukah, Tiffany!
TIM: Oh, the Ambassador.
TIM: Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya.
TIM: Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
TIM: Oh. Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
TIM: Oh? What's that?
TIM: Really glad you came.
TIM: Right downtown.
TIM: So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
TIM: So, I'll call.
TIM: Sounds more like Scottish.
TIM: Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
TIM: Thanks.
TIM: That's John Voight's pencil?
TIM: This was fun, you know?
TIM: Those aren't mahtzah balls.
TIM: Uh, no.
TIM: Uh, ok.
TIM: Um...
TIM: Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
TIM: We'll be ready in a minute.
TIM: Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later.
TIM: Well, this is my building.
TIM: Well. I'm really glad you came.
TIM: What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
TIM: What's up?
TIM: What, are you kidding?
TIM: Where are you from?
TIM: Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
TIM: Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?
TIM: Why? You bringing someone else?
TIM: With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
TIM: Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
TIM: You are.
TIM: You are.
TIM: You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
TIM: You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
TIM: You think someone's been tipped off?
TIMMY: Did...did you just double-dip that chip?
TIMMY: Gimme the chip! Gimme the chip!
TIMMY: Oh, you don't, huh?
TIMMY: That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!
TIMMY: What are you doing?
TIMMY: You dipped the chip. You took a bite. And you dipped again.
TIMMY: You double-dipped the chip!
TINA: Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth.
TINA: Elaine, we have a problem.
TINA: Here Kramer?
TINA: Hey, who took my cake?
TINA: Hi Elaine.
TINA: Hi, Jerry.
TINA: Hi.
TINA: I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.
TINA: Kramer,
TINA: Kramer, are you coming back to bed?
TINA: Oh, hi Elaine. What did you think of the coffee table?
TINA: Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you.
TINA: Please.
TINA: Such a great improv class tonight.
TINA: That's why there's a buzzer.
TINA: Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.
TINA: Well, let's see.
TINA: Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.
TINA: Well, there's been a number of complaints.
TINA: Yeah, um, you seem little bit dysfunctional.
TINA: You're getting kicked out.
TOBY: BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo!
TOBY: Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!
TOBY: He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.
TOBY: Hi!
TOBY: How are you doing today?
TOBY: Maybe it'll be you!
TOBY: Me? Nothing's wrong with me.
TOBY: My pinky toe!
TOBY: No, that's it. Get out of the way.
TOBY: No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.
TOBY: No...
TOBY: Oh no, no thank you.
TOBY: Oh well, I could use some coffee.
TOBY: Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.'
TOBY: Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny!
TOBY: Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! How did you come up with this idea?
TOBY: Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.
TOBY: Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!
TOBY: Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!
TOBY: Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?
TOBY: Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!'
TOBY: Oh, that is so true, yes!
TOBY: Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!
TOBY: This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! Touch! Touch them! I've never been to a comedy club before!
TOBY: Well, how would you like it if I called security?
TOBY: Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you.
TOBY: Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?
TOBY: Wow! Me! A senior editor! I'd like that.
TOBY: Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on!
TOBY: You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!
TOBY: You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...

TODD: You are so centered.
TOM: Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?
TOM: He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house.
TOM: Hey.

TOM: I'll have a hamburger. That's it.
TOM: I'm Kramer.
TOM: I'm not gonna say it like that.
TOM: Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do.
TOM: Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?
TOM: Levels.
TOM: May I?
TOM: Oh! I'll be comfortable.

TONY: Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around.

TONY: dude aah.......
TONY: George! Kramer!
TONY: Have you been picking at it?
TONY: Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles.
TONY: hey George, you got anything to eat dude?
TONY: Hey Jerry, it's Tony.
TONY: hey Kramer
TONY: hey, hey Kramer my man, what are you doing mañana?
TONY: Hey. Hey? where is my popcorn babe?
TONY: hey? you think if I jumped off that balcony I'd get hurt?
TONY: Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?
TONY: I don't know, I don't know
TONY: I really don't remember, I was kinda out of it for the 1st couple of days, I was on a lot of medication, it was kinda like haze, it was pretty cool
TONY: I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?
TONY: I'm drawing a blank, babe
TONY: Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. See this gasket? I have no confidence in that gasket.
TONY: just beat it dude!
TONY: Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But this engine's running on my sweat and my blood.
TONY: my popcorn, you were supposed to get me popcorn what? would you forget about me babe?
TONY: no
TONY: no no no no, I'm thinking.. rock-climbing
TONY: Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from me, I don't forget that.

TOR: And some couchgrass.
TOR: Cleavers.
TOR: Do you use hot water in the shower?
TOR: I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.
TOR: Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.
TOR: No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.
TOR: Oh, yes.. yes.. Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109..
TOR: Stop using it.
TOR: What month were you born?
TOR: Would you not put your foot on that please?
TOR: You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.
TOR: You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind.
TOR: You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.
TOR: You're eating too much dairy. May I?
TOR: Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark.
TRUCK DRIVER: Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!
TRUCK DRIVER: Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!
TURNING POINT: At first, Kew Gardens was an enclave of large homes offered to ``acceptable purchasers only'' by the Kew Gardens Corp. However, in the 1920s large apartment houses were built on the sections close to Queens Boulevard and Union Turnpike.
TUTTLE: George, I'm surprised to see you here.
TUTTLE: I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what you've been up to all week.
TUTTLE: I thought you would have taken the large office.
TUTTLE: I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.
TUTTLE: What have you been doing all week?
TUTTLE: You haven't done anything with this.
TUTTLE: You're not Pensky material.

TV NEWSCASTER: Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called 'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as Kramer.
TV VOICE: It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha..
TV VOICE: Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..
TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
TV: . . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead.
TV: . . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.
TV: . . . third being waived in.
TV: A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing.
TV: And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep right field and it's gone.
TV: As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies.
TV: Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill.
TV: Here's a new twist on car pooling: Early this morning, a lost Manhattanite drove through a residential backyard and wound up in a swimming pool near Ithaca, New York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a passenger, seemed a little freaked out.
TV: Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . .
TV: That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez.
TV: the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical.
TV: The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.
TVVOICE: Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.
TVVOICE: Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting. And a ball to left field...

UNCLE LEO: But she's an anti-Semite.
UNCLE LEO: Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?

UNCLE LEO: Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.
UNCLE LEO: I am calm.
UNCLE LEO: I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
UNCLE LEO: I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!
UNCLE LEO: I got your package.
UNCLE LEO: I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! Hello! Wait!

UNCLE LEO: No, for the walking tours.
UNCLE LEO: No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows.
UNCLE LEO: Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
UNCLE LEO: Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em.
UNCLE LEO: Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.

UNCLE LEO: She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
UNCLE LEO: She left.
UNCLE LEO: She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
UNCLE LEO: So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
UNCLE LEO: That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions...
UNCLE LEO: Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
UNCLE LEO: They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.
UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about?
UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about?
UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about?
UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
UNCLE LEO: What are you writing?
UNCLE LEO: What kind of checks?
UNCLE LEO: What should I do with it?
UNCLE LEO: What?
UNCLE LEO: Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
UNCLE LEO: Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
UNCLE LEO: You know Jeffrey's favorite animal: the leopard.
UNCLE LEO: You're not my nurse.
UNCLE LEO: Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?
UNCLE LEO: Your wife?
UNCLE MAC: Its based on all my experiences!
UNCLE MAC: Jerry, did I tell you that Im writing a book? An autobiography.
UNCLE MAC: Watch what you say to this guy. Hell put it in his next act!
USHA: Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place.
USHA: Here's the registry. Send her a gift, and be glad you did not have to go.
USHA: You're not going to the wedding, are you?
USHER: A crazy clown is after you? Oh that?s rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through.

VALERIE: I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny.
VALERIE: I'll call for help.
VALERIE: I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I hit the button for poison control and I get you!
VALERIE: I'm gonna go put these in some water.
VALERIE: Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her speed-dial.
VALERIE: My stepmother got to you, didn't she?
VALERIE: No, still me.
VALERIE: Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the dinner, and the play, and the hansom cab ride.
VALERIE: Oh.
VALERIE: Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews.
VALERIE: Someplace nice this time?
VALERIE: Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial.
VALERIE: That's her on the other line, isn't it?
VALERIE: Uh, it's Valerie.
VALERIE: Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off the speed-dial completely!
VALERIE: Who's this?
VALERIE: You deserve it.
VANDELAY: How did you get in here?
VANDELAY: Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?
VANDELAY: Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?
VANDELAY: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
VANDELAY: Mr. Chiles.
VANDELAY: Mr. Hoyt.
VANDELAY: Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.
VANDELAY: Order in this court!
VANDELAY: Order!
VANDELAY: Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned.
VANDELAY: Proceed.
VANDELAY: Sit down, Mr. Chiles.
VANDELAY: This is highly irregular.
VANDELAY: What do you mean?
VANDELAY: Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference?
VANESSA: Almost exclusively...
VANESSA: Forget it.
VANESSA: How big a tip do you think itd take to get him to stop?
VANESSA: How do you know Pamela?
VANESSA: How masculine.
VANESSA: I cant tell you.
VANESSA: I dont know. I just worry about trips like this. Its a lot of pressure.
VANESSA: I know. You mentioned it.
VANESSA: I said the market fluctuates. Remember?
VANESSA: I thought engineers do that.
VANESSA: I told you not to sell.
VANESSA: Importer?
VANESSA: Ill supply the hat.
VANESSA: Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.
VANESSA: No, its got a little battery.
VANESSA: No, its okay.
VANESSA: Not especially.
VANESSA: Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.
VANESSA: Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two?
VANESSA: Oh, that was you?
VANESSA: Oh, you know Bricker! From where?
VANESSA: Oh, youve never heard of it.
VANESSA: Really. What do you design?
VANESSA: Really? Could we go fishing up there?
VANESSA: Really? That explains it.
VANESSA: Really? Which company?
VANESSA: Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
VANESSA: Sure! Hi!
VANESSA: That stock? I thought you got out of that?
VANESSA: Thats probably why we're-
VANESSA: Thats probably why were staying here, because you lost money on the stock.
VANESSA: Thats right! Yea, whatre you doing here?
VANESSA: They have marlin in Vermont?
VANESSA: Vanessa.
VANESSA: Very funny! What do you do?
VANESSA: We gotta run. Happy birthday!
VANESSA: We went to law school together.
VANESSA: What can we do? Its raining.
VANESSA: Why didnt you do something?
VANESSA: Why dont you relax and take your jacket off?
VANESSA: Yeah, and that woman was your...
VANESSA: Yeah, Ive been thinking about it.

VIVIAN: She's American citizen, I have seen her passport.
VIVIAN: Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best.
VIVIAN: This is insane.
VIVIAN: Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight.
VIVIAN: Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call.
VIVIAN: Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around.
VIVIAN: Where's Jimmy?
VIVIAN: Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry?
VIVIAN: Yes it it.
VIVIAN: You haven't seen Jimmy for years.
VIVIAN: You...very knowledgeable.

WALTER: What's with her arms? They just hang like salamis.
WATKINS: All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying.
WATKINS: Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.
WATKINS: I love 'em.
WATKINS: It's T-bone.
WATKINS: That sounds good. I'll have one, too.
WELLS: Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.
WELLS: That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night.
WELLS: There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly.
WELLS: Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote There's no love lost with that group.
WELLS: Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.
WELLS: Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.
WELLS: Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.
WENDY: A delicate genius?
WENDY: Ah.
WENDY: Bye Jerry.
WENDY: Elaine?
WENDY: Have you tried heat and ice on it?
WENDY: Hi.
WENDY: How did you hear that?
WENDY: I am really glad I took the day off.
WENDY: I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?
WENDY: I'm dropping you off.
WENDY: I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.
WENDY: Let me give you my card.
WENDY: Oh sure. You have insurance, right?
WENDY: Oh, hi Jerry.
WENDY: Oh, ho.
WENDY: Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.
WENDY: Oh, well.
WENDY: Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
WENDY: Right. It's only three blocks.
WENDY: So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
WENDY: Sure.
WENDY: Well, I'll see you guys later. Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
WENDY: Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.
WENDY: Well, I...
WENDY: Well, why not?
WENDY: Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.
WENDY: What's going on?
WENDY: What's the problem?
WENDY: What, is there anything wrong with him?
WENDY: Why, what's wrong with my hair?
WENDY: Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...
WENDY: Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
WENDY: Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
WENDY: Yes.
WEST: George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.
WEST: I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?
WEST: Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.
WEST: No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.
WEST: No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea.
WEST: So how are the seats?
WEST: Well, enjoy the game. I think you better take off that Orioles cap.
WEST: Well, if you have a lot of money.
WEST: Yes, yes, yes, I am!
WHATLEY: Hey! Kramer
WHATLEY: OH!! She's over at Dr.Cessman's office. We find it fun to swap now and then.
WHATLEY: Sheryl, would you ready the Nitro please?
WHATLEY: So what'ill it be? Novocaine?
WHATLEY: Why don't we just clear a path first.
WHATLEY: Yeah Well....I do what I can. How've you been.
WHATLEY: You remember Mr. Thirsty.

WIFE: Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?
WILCOX: I would describe it as restrained jubilation.
WILCOX: Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it.
WILHELM: ...did you go down to payroll?
WILHELM: ...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
WILHELM: About what?
WILHELM: Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, w-we've searched everywhere, th-there's no sign of him. n-n-Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir.
WILHELM: And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
WILHELM: Are you feeling all right George?
WILHELM: George! George, get a hold of yourself!
WILHELM: George!?
WILHELM: George, have you seen Morgan?
WILHELM: George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
WILHELM: George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar.
WILHELM: George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?
WILHELM: George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. I'll let you get back to work, George.
WILHELM: George. George.
WILHELM: George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
WILHELM: Get started? I don't understand, George.
WILHELM: Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.
WILHELM: Have you seen Morgan?
WILHELM: He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
WILHELM: He's just being loyal to me, sir.
WILHELM: He's my protégé.
WILHELM: I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one.
WILHELM: I did?
WILHELM: I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.
WILHELM: I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
WILHELM: I understand.
WILHELM: I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets.
WILHELM: I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.
WILHELM: If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward.
WILHELM: Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?
WILHELM: Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
WILHELM: Lemme think here.
WILHELM: Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
WILHELM: Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets.
WILHELM: Morning George.
WILHELM: Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
WILHELM: No no no sir. Well, you see, I don't think--
WILHELM: No, He's late.
WILHELM: No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.
WILHELM: Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.
WILHELM: Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
WILHELM: Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
WILHELM: Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
WILHELM: Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
WILHELM: Oh. Ah-ha..
WILHELM: Parents.
WILHELM: Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
WILHELM: Right. Yessir.
WILHELM: So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?
WILHELM: So...
WILHELM: That's right. What's for dinner?
WILHELM: That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. You really nailed it.
WILHELM: The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?
WILHELM: The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.
WILHELM: There's your answer. Downtown.
WILHELM: They took a pitching machine, a batting cage, the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now, we have reasons to believe it's an inside job.
WILHELM: They're in my office, right now.
WILHELM: Top priority.
WILHELM: Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
WILHELM: Uh-a Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident, and trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.
WILHELM: Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.
WILHELM: Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
WILHELM: Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
WILHELM: Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
WILHELM: What's the matter with you?!
WILHELM: What's this?
WILHELM: What, sir?
WILHELM: Wilhelm? My name is Tanya.
WILHELM: Wow! What an, Entrance! And eh, who might this be?
WILHELM: Yes George.
WILHELM: Yes Sir!
WILHELM: Yes Sir!
WILHELM: Yes sir, yes sir.
WILHELM: Yes sir.
WILHELM: Yes sir.
WILHELM: Yes sir.
WILHELM: Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
WILHELM: Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
WILHELM: Yessir.
WILHELM: Yessir?
WILHELM: You look a little warm.
WILHELM: You mean you haven't been to payroll?
WILHELM: You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets.
WILKIE: All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen.
WILKIE: I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.
WILLIAMS: Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?
WILLIE SR: I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel.
WILLIE SR: Not Skittles.
WILLIE: Are we about through here?
WILLIE: Are you saying he grabbed your candy bar away from you?
WILLIE: Candy line-up?
WILLIE: Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you dont talk.
WILLIE: He likes it!
WILLIE: Hey Jerry, you know my wife Donna.
WILLIE: Hey Jerry.
WILLIE: Hey, Jerry. You dropping off?
WILLIE: Hey, nice jacket.
WILLIE: I thought you said it was a Twix.
WILLIE: I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things.
WILLIE: It took you an hour?
WILLIE: Im not.
WILLIE: Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaners code.
WILLIE: Jerry, come on.
WILLIE: Jerry.
WILLIE: Maybe it was.
WILLIE: Mr. Costanza, I really dont have time for this.
WILLIE: Nougat?
WILLIE: Now?
WILLIE: Positive?
WILLIE: Sir, what, exactly, is the problem?
WILLIE: Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the coat?
WILLIE: Well ... ahh.
WILLIE: Well, I, I need to see that ticket.
WILLIE: What about the Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar?
WILLIE: What are you doing with it?
WILLIE: What are you gettin at?
WILLIE: When did you bring the car in?
WILLIE: Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very flattering.
WILLIE: Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You cant, get anything without a number.
WILLIE: You came by to ask that?
WILTON: Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?
WILTON: Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.

WINONA: How did you get these?
WINONA: I guess I could go for a bite.
WINONA: I like your place. It's very unassuming.
WINONA: I'll come down.
WINONA: It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.
WINONA: Jerry, I really need it back. It, it is mine.
WINONA: Oh, by the way. That TV Guide I gave you, I need it back.
WINONA: Oh.
WINONA: Ooh, I love that place, but it's usually so crowded. Can we get a table?
WINONA: So, where are we gonna go eat?
WINONA: Sure, take it.
WINONA: That's Al Roker.
WINONA: Well, I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use that interview with Al Roker.
WINONA: What guys?
WINONA: What?
WINONA: Yeah?
WINONA: You know, it's late. I should probably just go home.
WINONA: You made what?
WINONA: You mean like, an Indian giver?!
WOMAN 1: That's right.
WOMAN 2: No, I'm not a psycho.
WOMAN 2: Right.
WOMAN 2: Yes, I was full.
WOMAN AT ANOTHER TABLE: I'm with you, Poppie!
WOMAN AT BEACH: There is a beached whale, she's dying.
WOMAN AT PHONE: Where? I didn't see you.
WOMAN BEHIND ELAINE: It's all yours.
WOMAN IN THE CROWD: Not my Harry. He flies first class.
WOMAN: A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
WOMAN: A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
WOMAN: A thousand.
WOMAN: About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
WOMAN: AHAaaaaaaaaa!
WOMAN: All right, we're done. You can have it now.
WOMAN: And I'm her protégé. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
WOMAN: And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
WOMAN: Are you going upstairs? Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him. I havelost my fiancé, the poor baby.
WOMAN: Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
WOMAN: Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
WOMAN: But I didn't do anything.
WOMAN: Bye George.
WOMAN: Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
WOMAN: Come here.
WOMAN: David, you are so funny.
WOMAN: Did he send you part of our VCR?
WOMAN: Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
WOMAN: Do you know how to double-clutch?
WOMAN: Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
WOMAN: Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
WOMAN: Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... midnight blue?
WOMAN: Excuse me. Can I help you?
WOMAN: Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
WOMAN: George Costanza? Estelles son?
WOMAN: Get away from me you creep.
WOMAN: Get the bikes.
WOMAN: Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
WOMAN: Goin' on four years.
WOMAN: Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
WOMAN: Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
WOMAN: Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call?
WOMAN: Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
WOMAN: Hi.
WOMAN: Hmm..
WOMAN: Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
WOMAN: How did this start?
WOMAN: How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
WOMAN: How well do you know her?
WOMAN: huh.
WOMAN: I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
WOMAN: I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
WOMAN: I don't know.
WOMAN: I don't know.
WOMAN: I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
WOMAN: I had it autographed for my uncle.
WOMAN: I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
WOMAN: I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
WOMAN: I wonder what happened to my fiancé. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fiancé?
WOMAN: I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
WOMAN: I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.
WOMAN: I'm taking your clothes.
WOMAN: It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
WOMAN: It was great working with you. Your hands are beautiful.
WOMAN: It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
WOMAN: Im allergic to coconut.
WOMAN: Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
WOMAN: Like what?
WOMAN: Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
WOMAN: Make your-self comfortable.
WOMAN: Mm. Bye Jerry.
WOMAN: Mr. O'Brien?
WOMAN: Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you.
WOMAN: Mulva?
WOMAN: Newman, I'm bored.
WOMAN: Nice to meet you.
WOMAN: Nice.
WOMAN: No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
WOMAN: No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
WOMAN: No, no, no. It's all right.
WOMAN: No.
WOMAN: Nothin'? Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
WOMAN: Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
WOMAN: Oh, don't worry. I do.
WOMAN: Oh, hello.
WOMAN: Oh, hi.
WOMAN: Oh, I have Junior Mints.
WOMAN: Oh, Nice to meet you, George.
WOMAN: Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
WOMAN: Oh, oh Jerry...
WOMAN: Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... .....Joseph Puglia...
WOMAN: Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police The Old Mill Restaurant. Hurry!
WOMAN: Poor.
WOMAN: Really?
WOMAN: Seinsmelled?
WOMAN: So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
WOMAN: So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
WOMAN: So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
WOMAN: So, are they a nice couple?
WOMAN: So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
WOMAN: So, when's your due date?
WOMAN: So, you're in 'the market'?
WOMAN: Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
WOMAN: Thank you.
WOMAN: That man should really be in a sanitarium.
WOMAN: Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?
WOMAN: They're quite exquisite!
WOMAN: They're so soft and milky white.
WOMAN: Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
WOMAN: Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
WOMAN: Vincent!
WOMAN: Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
WOMAN: Well I won't be long.
WOMAN: Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
WOMAN: Well, come on!
WOMAN: Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play.
WOMAN: Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
WOMAN: Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
WOMAN: Well, I'm his mother. Vincent, what's going on here?
WOMAN: Well, this is where I get off.
WOMAN: Well, you're reading the classifieds.
WOMAN: What about a shooting star?
WOMAN: What are you doing?
WOMAN: What d'you have here?
WOMAN: What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
WOMAN: What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
WOMAN: What is it?
WOMAN: What is it?
WOMAN: What're you so tense about?
WOMAN: What's the problem?
WOMAN: What?
WOMAN: What?
WOMAN: When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
WOMAN: Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
WOMAN: Where's Glenn?
WOMAN: Which market?
WOMAN: Which one?
WOMAN: Who are you?
WOMAN: Who are you?
WOMAN: Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
WOMAN: Why don't you just make another wish?
WOMAN: Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
WOMAN: Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.
WOMAN: Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
WOMAN: Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
WOMAN: Yeah, it's in my purse.
WOMAN: Yeah, not bad at all.
WOMAN: Yeah, what is it?
WOMAN: Yeah.
WOMAN: Yeah. I really have to be going.
WOMAN: Yes.
WOMAN: Yes.
WOMAN: You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
WOMAN: You don't know my name, do you?
WOMAN: You don't know.
WOMAN: You know the time!
WOMAN: You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
WOMAN: You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
WOMAN: You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
WOMAN: You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
WOMAN: You looking for a job?
WOMAN: You make your father sit here all day?
WOMAN: You want to give it a try?
WOMAN: You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
WOMAN: Your hands.
WOMANEWMAN: Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier for Elaine.
WOMEN: A wedding?
WOMEN: Lesbian wedding.
WOMEN: She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son.
WOMEN: There is no he. So, who's getting married?
WOMEN: What's ironic?
WORKER: $ 6.50 your change.
WORKER: Calzone!
WORKER: Hey! You steal my money!!
WORKER: Hey, the steam valve's broke.
WORKER: I know what you try to do. Get out. Don't ever come back ever.
WORKER: I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust...
WORKER: No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You can't pay with this.
WORKER: Number 49.
WORKER: Sure. It's just a little steamy.
WORKER: The best!
WORKER: The park, why?
WORKER: Then no calzones.
WORKER: Three calzones.
WORKER: Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.
WORKER: What can I get you?
WORKER: What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is this? Your paying in pennies?
WORKER: Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket.
WX: Here's your big salad to go.
WX: Would you like some more coffee?
WYCK: ...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh...
WYCK: Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.
WYCK: Are you okay, George?
WYCK: Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?
WYCK: George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?
WYCK: George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic.
WYCK: George.
WYCK: George.
WYCK: George...
WYCK: I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.
WYCK: Is that a Keats poem?
WYCK: Is that right?
WYCK: Not.
WYCK: Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.
WYCK: Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.
WYCK: Of course, it would have been yours.
WYCK: Oh, no, not even close.
WYCK: Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.
WYCK: Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value: $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?
WYCK: Pardon?
WYCK: So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.
WYCK: Susan would be proud of what you're doing.
WYCK: These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.
WYCK: They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.
WYCK: This would have been your wedding gift.
WYCK: Well, that's a good point.
WYCK: Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?
WYCK: Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate ...accident.
WYCK: Wyck.
WYCK: Yes.
WYCK: You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! Contratulations, young man.
YELLING GUY: All right everybody, take a five.
YOUNG COP: Excuse me.
YOUNG COP: Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease. Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.
ZACH: Hi, I'm Zach.
ZACH: I'm burning up! Elaine!
ZACH: Well, this is the first day of the rest of my life!
ZEKE: Finish your drink?
ZEKE: Let's get that bastard bring us another round!
ZEKE: When's that bastard comin' to Houston?
ZUBIN: And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either.
ZUBIN: I'm Zubin.
ZUBIN: If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip.
ZUBIN: Please, call us Usha and Zubin.
ZUBIN: You know, it's the only country that still has the plague? I mean, the plague! Please!
